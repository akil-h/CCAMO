wife \u2019 s life , according to the associated press . \nwalker , who was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder , wrote a book in 2008 detailing his long struggle with mental illness . \nhe wrote candidly about sitting at his kitchen table in 1991 , pointing a gun loaded with a single bullet and playing russian roulette . \nwalker \u2019 s ex - wife told ABC news that at one point during their marriage , her husband pointed a pistol at her head and said blow your f \u2019 ing brains out . \u201d \nshe filed for divorce in 2001 . \nbeyond his violent history , walker also joined the board of directors of a foundation operated by pro - trump - attorney - turned - qanon - celebrity lin wood , underscoring the NFL legend \u2019 s affiliation with the far - right conspiracy movement . \nwood , who first gained notoriety when he represented richard jewell , a security guard falsely accused of planting the bomb in centennial olympic park during the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta , georgia , has since reinvented himself as a trump advocate . \nwood filed lawsuits seeking to undo the 2020 presidential election results in several swing states , which made him a celebrity in the far - right qanon conspiracy movement . \nprior to becoming a qanon mainstay , wood founded the # fightback foundation with a stated mission to \u201c protect and defend the constitutional rights , livelihoods and property of people and businesses that are being targeted and destroyed . \u201d \nwood \u2019 s foundation gained notoriety as part of the legal defense team for kyle rittenhouse , the teenager charged with the fatal shooting of in kenosha , wisconsin . \nthe foundation also set up a fund to cover the legal fees , eventually amassing more the $ 2 million in donations . \nwood , however , eventually shifted his attention away from the case in favor of trying to undo the presidential election results in georgia . \nrittenhouse \u2019 s mother later claimed that wood wanted rittenhouse to stay in jail to maximize the fundraising potential . \nit is worth noting that wood and several other pro - trump lawyers are facing potential discipline for a lawsuit they filed widespread voter fraud in the most recent U.S. presidential election . \ndespite the controversy surrounding wood , walker continues to maintain a relationship with the lawyer . \u201c \nherschel is aware of the many false attacks on me and my mental health by the state bar of georgia , the media , and others who do not stand for truth , \u201d wood wrote on telegram in february 2021 . \u201c \nherschel told me that he would stand proudly side by side with me to fight the false accusations against me and work to defend our constitution . \u201d \nwalker \u2019 s campaign has also raised concerns from fellow republicans , many of whom are unsure of the pro - footballer \u2019 s stance on key conservative issues or how he will handle discussing his well - publicized mental health struggles . \nas republicans aim to win back the senate majority they lost in january when the democrats won the two senate runoff elections in georgia , some may worry that walker could prove to be a detriment to their cause . \n"}, {"id": 1, "body": "ATLANTA ( the borowitz report ) \u2014 president biden \u2019 s infrastructure plan came under harsh attack from the georgia congresswoman marjorie taylor greene , who argued that the bill contains \u201c no provision whatsoever \u201d for building a giant dome to shield the nation from jewish space lasers . \ngreene , whose address to the house of representatives was interrupted at several points by standing ovations from her republican colleagues , said that the absence of a dome to offer protection against hebraic laser attacks made the bill a \u201c non -

stagnant incomes of most american workers and combat largest annual federal budget in constant dollars since world war II , he is laying down a political gauntlet to republicans who are betting they can obstruct his initiatives and break democrats \u2019 shaky majorities in congress in next year 's midterm election . \nbiden , speaking about the economy at cleveland community college on thursday afternoon , delivered an impassioned argument in support of the sweeping domestic agenda to be outlined in his budget proposal to congress for fiscal year 2022 , which begins oct. 1 . \n` ` this is our moment up and the middle out , '' the president said , arguing that investments in infrastructure , workers and families will make america 's economy fairer and help the country keep pace with global rivals , china in particular . \nhe continued to push for his proposals to raise taxes on corporations and the richest individuals to pay for the investments and tax breaks for low- and middle -

' '' \nany president 's budget request to congress is primarily a political document , a fiscal blueprint spelling out the administration 's priorities . \ncongress sometimes all but ignoring them . \nbut with democrats in control of the house and senate , if narrowly , biden can expect a respectful hearing for his first full - year budget proposal as president , and some success . \nhe is taking a much more bold and aggressive posture politically than president obama did . \nbiden also advocates bipartisanship , but has suggested that if republicans resist compromise , he will try to pass his program with only democrats ' votes or take the fight to the voters . \nwhile polls show the , pressing his plans without bipartisan buy - in would be a political gamble given the highly polarized electorate . \nthe president and a relatively few republican lawmakers continue to negotiate on an infrastructure bill . \nyet most republicans have balked at the far more active role biden envisions for the government , while raising concerns about the risks of inflation and other economic dangers of increasing the nation \u2019 s already large debt . \nunder biden \u2019 s budget proposal , the federal deficit for the next fiscal year would hit $ 1.8 trillion budget office projected in february , based on current spending and taxes . \nbut it is less than the $ 2.3 - trillion shortfall expected for the current fiscal year or the $ 3.1 - trillion deficit for fiscal 2020 \u2014 periods when the economic downturn amid the pandemic , along with the tax cuts president trump signed into law in 2017 , contributed to much - reduced government revenues . \nof the $ 6 trillion in spending biden is proposing for next year , more than half is for social security , medicare , medicaid and other mandatory inherited . \nmuch of the rest maintains funding for existing military and domestic programs . \nyet biden 's proposed additions are significant . \nthe spending for infrastructure and social programs , together with tax breaks for all but the wealthiest americans , would cost roughly $ 4.5 trillion spread out over 10 years . \nbiden \u2019 s plan to increase taxes on corporations and the very wealthy would offset the cost of infrastructure and social programs over 15 years , the administration has projected . \nstill , in this decade , the U.S. debt . \none common measure of fiscal sustainability is debt as a share of the nation \u2019 s gross domestic output , or economic output . \nthat ratio was about 80 % before the pandemic but hit 100 % at the end of last year and would rise to 117 % by 2031 under the biden budget \u2014 10 percentage points higher than what the CBO had projected in february in its baseline forecast . \neconomists say that level of debt to GDP would still be manageable as long as the united states is continuing to grow , the dollar is the world \u2019 s reserve currency and interest rates remain very low . \u201c \nI would expect a lot of hype and fearmongering about the debt , \u201d said seth hanlon , a senior fellow at the liberal center for american progress and a former special assistant to obama on tax and budget issues . \nbut he noted that , over the last decade , many analysts and economists have come to view past hand - wringing over the federal debt as overdone , and to agree priority at a time of crisis and low interest rates . \u201c \ngetting bipartisanship is , all things equal , better than not , '' hanlon said . \n` ` but one lesson that was learned from the obama years , and particularly the drawn - out passage of ACA [ the affordable care act ] is that the longer you drag it out , the harder it gets .

i.e . \nit is quite a large gap . \nfinding intermediate viruses would solve two puzzles . \none is geographical : by what means or in what host animal ( s ) did the virus get to wuhan ? \nthe second is genetic : what viruses were the evolutionary intermediates between ratg13 and SARS - cov-2 ? \nthe targets of this hunt have therefore been bats but also civets or mink , either one of which might have been the vector that brought COVID-19 to wuhan . \neven partial evidence for such a trail of viral intermediates would support a likely zoonotic origin of SARS - cov-2 . \nto this end , according to that WHO report , scientists across china have sampled and tested over 80,000 animals , including 1,100 bats just in hubei province , of which wuhan is the capital . \nyet beyond a few tantalising discoveries , which are discussed below , the search has been unsuccessful . \nthe has been scantly reported by the media and sometimes its significance has been dismissed entirely . \nthus , the editor of nature journal recently told the times higher education supplement that there was an \u201c absence of new evidence \u201d on the COVID-19 origin question . \nonly a handful of mass media articles and none in the scientific literature have thus done proper justice to the negative results of the sampling in china . \nexceptions are \u201c no one can find the animal that gave people covid-19 \u201c in the MIT technology review in newsweek that expertly articulated the essential points . \nparallel to the hunt inside china , a broader international one has taken place across neighbouring asian countries . \nthis hunt has mainly focussed on testing bats , which are the reservoir hosts of most coronaviruses . \nunlike most of the chinese search , its results have been reported in the scientific literature ( e.g . \nlee et al . , \n2020 ) . \nas a consequence , in 2021 alone , a series of very near relatives of SARS - cov-2 have been published . \nthese , 2021 ) , cambodia ( hul et al . , \n2021 ) , thailand ( wacharapluesadee et al . , \n2021 ) , and yunnan province , china ( zhou et al . , \n2021 ; li L. et al . , \n2021 ) . \nthe findings of this international search have likewise been poorly covered by the media ; either ignored , or , much more rarely , misrepresented ( lytras et al . , \n2021 ) . \nthe purpose of this article is therefore to straighten the record . \nit shows that the positive and of profound importance for understanding the origin of SARS - cov-2 . \nsince the consequences of the chinese search are fairly simple and better known , this article focuses mainly on analysing and interpreting the published results of the international virus search . \nin this article we reveal that the new coronavirus genomes from asia contain sufficient information to narrow down the geographical source of the direct bat progenitor of SARS - cov-2 to a quite small region , the south - central part of the chinese province of yunnan . \nin other words , this analysis identifies with where a bat virus that ultimately became SARS - cov-2 left its bat reservoir host , initiating the chain of events that led to the COVID-19 pandemic . \nthe analysis does not specify the precise nature of this initiation event . \nthe jump out of bats may have been into an intermediate host ( that later went on to infect a human ) , or it may have been a jump directly into a human ; or even the virus may have been procured as part of a research project . \nnevertheless , such a the jump from bats represents a major step forward . \nits implications for understanding the origin of SARS - cov-2 are profound because the requirement for a yunnan connection markedly constrains origin theories . \nfor example , advocates of the imported frozen food theory favoured in china now have to explain how imported food came to wuhan carrying a virus from yunnan ( zhou and shi , 2021 ) . \nlikewise , ideas that have circulated about possible european origins of the virus must now explain how a european patient zero could have acquired that the bioweapon theory of dr li - meng yan is ruled out by the newly discovered viruses discussed here . \nbut perhaps the greatest significance of this finding will turn out to be that the region of yunnan indicated as the likely geographic origin is centred on a place called the mojiang mine . \nthis mine is already well - known to COVID-19 origins investigators . \nthe mojiang mine was the site , in april 2012 , of an apparent coronavirus outbreak . \nthis outbreak affected six miners and killed three of them ( rahalkar and bahulikar became ill were shovelling bat guano , implicating the likelihood of infection by a bat virus . \nthe mojiang mine is also where ratg13 , the closest known natural relative of SARS - cov-2 was found by zheng - li shi of the WIV . \nratg13 was collected during sampling efforts to determine the cause of the mine outbreak . \nfor these and other reasons , the mine is already the focus of lab origin theories . \nit is highly suggestive , to say the least , for this new evidence to point so precisely to this bat progenitor . \nthe finding is thus rich with irony as well as importance . \nthe chinese and international searches for SARS - cov-2 - related coronaviruses were supposed to reveal a zoonotic origin and refute a lab leak ( anderson et al . , \n2020 ) . \ninstead , they have achieved the almost direct opposite . \nour assessment of the widespread mischaracterisation of all this new evidence \u2013 in the media and the scientific literature \u2013 is therefore that most scientists and most media still resist evidence when it challenges a zoonotic origin or supports a lab leak . \nthese : intensive search in china yields no evidence for intermediate hosts based on the examples of the previous coronavirus outbreaks , the first SARS ( hereafter , SARS one ) and MERS , an outbreak trail leading to SARS - cov-2 ought to begin with a reservoir host , in this case presumably bats ( wang et al . , \n2006 ; corman et al . , \n2014 ; hu et al . , \n2017 ; luk et al . , \n2019 ) . \nthe virus reached humans because an intermediate animal capable of amplifying the virus ( presumably the virus from bats . \nthis intermediate animal host with its intermediate viruses should be a species found in close proximity to humans at or near the outbreak site . \nthus , a pool of viruses very highly related ( \u224899.9 % similar ) to SARS - cov-2 should be findable in whatever animal species it was that transmitted the virus to humans . \nmost likely , these intermediates will be domesticated or farmed or smuggled animals ( opriessnig and huang , 2020 ) . \nthus , in the case of SARS one , himalayan were the likely amplifying species ; in the case of MERS , domesticated dromedaries were certainly the source ( guan et al . , \n2003 ; azhar et al . , \n2014 ) . \nhowever , for SARS - cov-2 , no comparable pool of viruses in intermediate hosts has yet been found . \nwhile the pandemic was still young , this absence was unremarkable . \nbut , given the extent of sampling in china , the lack of evidence for any part of a transmission chain from bats in yunnan to humans in wuhan now represents origin . \nthis lack is frequently dismissed by comparing how long it took to find the origins of SARS one ( 2002 - 4 ) and MERS ( 2011 - 2012 ) . \nbut since those outbreaks a lot of resources have been devoted , in china and elsewhere , to sampling and identifying viruses , particularly coronaviruses ( e.g . \nlatinne et al . , \n2020 ) . \nthere have consequently been vast improvements in our understanding of virus ecology ( for example , we now know about bat reservoirs ) . \nat the same time there leaps in genome sequencing ( especially next generation sequencing ) , in database technology , in virus taxonomy , and in virus isolation methods . \nconsequently , the current failure to find a zoonotic proximal origin profoundly challenges the notion that SARS - cov-2 has a natural animal source . \nit is no credit to the media or the scientific community that this finding has received so little attention . \nconclusion two : the international search discovers a SARS - cov-2 lineage with a pronounced geographical distribution the second major finding is even more compelling but so derives primarily from the fruits of the international search for bats infected with coronaviruses . \nthis international search has yielded viral genome sequences that are close relatives of SARS - cov-2 . \nall are from various parts of asia ( hu et al . , \n2018 ; zhou P. et al . , \n2020 ; zhou H. et al . , \n2020 ; hul et al . , \n2021 ; wacharapluesadee et al . , \n2021 ; murakami et al . , \n2021 ; zhou et al . , \n2021 ; li L. et al . , \n2021 ) . \nthese genomes , few from pangolins ) , represent the closest relatives of SARS - cov-2 known from nature . \nall are between 79 % and 96.1 % similar to SARS - cov-2 . \nvirtually all of these viruses were unknown before the pandemic began and some are even now published only as scientific preprints . \nsome are from newly sampled bat populations ( e.g . \nwacharapluesadee et al . , \n2021 ; zhou et al . , \n2021 ) . \nothers come from freezer searches for old untested samples ( e.g . \nmurakami et al . , \n2021 ) . \none is ignored sequence information from historical samples ( li L. et al . , \n2021 ) . \nthese twelve known closest relatives of SARS - cov-2 are listed in table 1 below . \nin date order of publication , table 1 specifies their viral names , their country or province of origin , the genetic similarity of their whole genomes to SARS - cov-2 ( in % ) , the distance of their sampling location from the mojiang mine and the species they were sampled from . \nthe mojiang mine , which is in central yunnan , was selected it is the location where the nearest naturally occurring relative of SARS - cov-2 , ratg13 , was found , in 2013 by zheng - li shi ( zhou P. et al . , \n2020 ) . \nthe coordinates for the mojiang mine used here ( N 23 \u00b0 10 \u2019 36 E 101 \u00b0 21 \u2019 28 \u201d ) are from canping huang \u2019 s 2016 phd thesis since those supplied by zheng - li shi ( N 23 \u00b0 3 \u2019 27073\u2033 , E 101 \u00b0 37 \u2019 16074\u2033 ) in table S1 of guo et al . , \n2021 are clearly incorrect . \nit should also of this analysis , the viruses called YN04/05/08 are treated here as one single virus . \nthis consolidation is merited because they are virtually identical in genome sequence and were found at the same location ( zhou et al . , \n2021 ) . \nthe same applies to the viruses shstt200 and shstt182 which are referred to here just as shstt200 ( hul et al . , \n2021 ) . \nthanks mainly to these newfound genome sequences , it is now evident that SARS - cov-2 , the pandemic - associated human virus , is just one member of seen in the phylogenetic tree shown in figure 1 below . \nthis lineage has been called the SARS - cov-2 - related lineage ( and independently the \u2018 ncov \u2019 lineage by lytras et al . , \n2021 ) ( guo et al . , \n2021 ) . \nthus , as shown in figure 1 , within the sarbecoviruses are three lineages . \nSARS one and its near relatives are at the top ( highlighted in pink ) . \nat the bottom is a novel lineage ( containing ratg15 ) very recently reported in a preprint by guo et , highlighted in blue , is the SARS - cov-2 lineage that is the focus of this analysis . \nthe implication of the existence of all such phylogenetic lineages is that the viruses within them have ( for unknown reasons ) recombined more - or - less readily with each other , but mostly not with viruses from other lineages ( boni et al . , \n2020 ) . \notherwise , the lineages would have merged . ( \nwe write \u2018 mostly \u2019 because prc31 , ZXC21 and ZC45 are partial exceptions to this rule , having segments derived from of the SARS - cov-2 lineage are reproductively ( i.e. , genetically ) isolated from the other two lineages . \nthis understanding is key to the analysis below because it means the SARS - cov-2 lineage can be treated as a distinct group whose members are evolving independently of the other lineages . \nby treating this lineage separately , the sampling location and sequence of each virus can be analysed to answer a question that is crucial to the origin mystery . \nwhere in the world did SARS - cov-2 come from ? \nin an interview given just after , peter ben embarek , leader of the WHO origins investigation team , expressed the following thought to an interviewer : \u201c [ H ] aving found other relatively close virus strains to SARS - cov-2 in the region also in south east asia where these bats live is a strong indication that \u2019 s where the source is \u201d south east asia is big place . \nbut ben embarek \u2019 s statement suggests how one can logically narrow down the possible origins of SARS - cov-2 . \nin fact , a more precise analysis than this between the wuhan institute of virology ( WIV ) and the ecohealth alliance used hundreds of partial viral sequences from china , most of them new to science , to map the geographical origin of SARS - cov-2 more precisely ( latinne et al . , \n2020 ) . \nthe authors concluded : \u201c [ W ] e found that SARS - cov-2 is likely derived from a clade of viruses originating in horseshoe bats ( rhinolophus spp . ) . \nthe geographic location of this origin appears to be yunnan province \u201d ( latinne et al . , \n2020 here to a lineage ] . \nrelatively little attention was paid at the time to this conclusion . \nthis is largely because the authors provided two substantial caveats . \nthe first was that viruses from outside china were not included in their study . \nthe second caveat was that their analysis used only a small fragment ( 440 nucleotides ) of the virus genome ( for most of their samples this was the only sequence information available ) . \nA complete coronavirus genome is approximately 30,000 nucleotides . \nbecause recombination between coronaviruses is might reasonably be expected to give different results . \nhowever , due to the new virus discoveries ( listed in table 1 ) , these caveats no longer apply . \nfor the SARS - cov-2 lineage one can therefore re - do the analysis using complete genomes for all currently identified viruses in the SARS - cov-2 lineage for which precise geographic location data is available . \nnone of the researchers who published the novel SARS - cov-2 lineage viruses in table 1 performed such an analysis ( nor did lytras et al . , \n2021 , who recently reviewed the evolutionary , such an analysis is simple to do . \nfirst , though , it requires excluding viruses whose sampling location is uncertain . \nhence , those virus sequences extracted from smuggled pangolins ( P4L and MP789 ) are not included in this geographic analysis . \nthis is because a virus found in a pangolin smuggled into china might have originated from almost anywhere in SE asia . \nthe other provenance question relates to prc31 . \naccording to the preprint describing it , prc31 is from \u201c yunnan \u201d ( li l.et al . , \nfor a more precise location but did not obtain one : however , according to the NGDC genome database , the accession called prc31 is from pu \u2019 er city . \nthis matches the initials ( which are not explained in the article ) . \npu \u2019 er city is a town 56 km ( in a straight line ) from the mojiang mine . \npu \u2019 er city , however , is also the name of an administrative district that encompasses the mine . \nthe furthest boundary of this district from the 250 km marks the maximum and 0 km the minimum presumed distance to the sampling site of prc31 . \ngiven this uncertainty we decided to omit prc31 from the distance plot ( figure 2 below ) . \nhowever , prc31 is important since , over certain parts of its genome , it is the closest known virus to SARS - cov-2 . \nit will therefore be discussed below , where appropriate , as will the pangolin genomes . \nafter excluding these viruses , the results are simple to interpret . \ntable 1 allows a comparison virus to SARS - cov-2 and the sampling location for each virus . \nthe closest relative of SARS - cov-2 ( ratg13 , 96.1 % similar at the nucleotide level ) was found at the mojiang mine in yunnan province . \nthe next closest genetic relatives of SARS - cov-2 are rmyn02 ( 93.2 % similar ) and rpyn06 ( 94.48 % similar ) . \nthese two viruses were both also found in yunnan , just 150 km away ( in a straight line ) from ratg13 . \nthe next two closest relatives of SARS - cov-2 are , almost equally raccs203 ( 91.15 % ) . \nthese two viruses were discovered 1,180 km away and 1,070 km away , respectively . \nthe next most distantly related ( after prc31 which can not be pinpointed ) are ZXC21 ( 87.39 % ) and ZC45 ( 87.63 % ) . \nthese were found 2,195 km away , followed by c_o319 ( 79.06 % ) from iwate , japan , 4,140 km away . \nthere is an obvious pattern here , which is even more evident when table 1 ( minus prc31 and the pangolin viruses figure 2 . \nthus , with the sole exception of YN04/05/08 , every virus in the SARS - cov-2 clade falls on an almost perfect straight line . \nbeginning from the discovery location of ratg13 , the further away from the mine a virus was found , the less closely related to SARS - cov-2 it is . \nthus , if we knew nothing else about the origin of SARS - cov-2 we would learn from this plot that , first , genetic variation among the bat viruses in this lineage is highly correlated with geographic location . \nsecond SARS - cov-2 came from a bat living at or near to the mojiang mine in south - central yunnan , china . \nin other words , the mojiang area of yunnan was the site of the key zoonotic leap where SARS - cov-2 \u2019 s ancestor exited its bat reservoir . \nthis leap may have been directly into a human . \nalternatively , the leap may have been into an intermediate host . \nthe third possibility is that the leap was assisted by scientists collecting or researching bat viruses . \nthese findings can also be displayed in map location of all the viruses plotted in figure 2 . \nthe only outlier in this analysis is YN04/05/08 . \nits presence in yunnan can presumably be explained as a less related virus that migrated back towards yunnan . \nan alternative possibility is that YN04/05/08 is not recombining with the other viruses in the lineage and is in the process of forming a new lineage . \nthis exception does not refute the overall analysis . \nonly the discovery of a natural virus that was closely related to SARS - cov-2 but that was found far away show that the progenitor of SARS - cov-2 might also have originated far from mojiang . \nto date , none has been found . \ncombining genome sequences with map locations is an established practice known as phylogeography and there are strong precedents ( in addition to latinne et al , 2020 ) for studying bat coronaviruses using this methodology . \nan important example , which is highly relevant since it also involves SARS - related coronaviruses with very similar bat hosts , is a study titled \u201c geographical structure of bat SARS - related coronaviruses \u201d ( yu et research done by yu ping , a student of zheng - li shi \u2019 s . \nthese authors concluded that viruses in the SARS one lineage circulated freely among the rhinolophid ( horseshoe ) bats that are their reservoir hosts ( bannerjee et al . , \n2019 ) . \nthis lack of host restriction meant that : \u201c [ S ] pace presents a greater barrier to virus diversification than host species for the evolution of bat sarsr - covs . \u201d \nin other words , geographic proximity better predicted the occurrence of specific isolates than did bat host predicted that these viruses moved freely within each species of horseshoe bat and only sometimes switched between them , and thus viral genetic variation would closely track bat species distributions , it seems instead that this lineage of coronaviruses easily switched between the different species of horseshoe bats that are their hosts . \nlargely unfettered movement between hosts means that , whenever new virus variants arise or new recombinant genomes arise , these can easily spread within one cave or one roosting site to other species ( of horseshoe bat ) . \nthey and sites . \npresumably , their bat hosts have life histories or specific behaviors , such as flight path routines or infrequent switching of roosting sites that can explain this limited viral movement . \nthe relevant consequence of this is that , within a lineage , virus location predicts the degree of similarity to other isolates . \nyu ping \u2019 s finding is consistent with a landmark study of SARS - related coronaviruses published by zheng - li shi \u2019 s lab at around the same time ( hu et al . , \n2017 ) . \nwhile at the applicability of phylogeographic approaches for these viruses , it turns out they are more likely to be the exception that proves the rule . \nin 2017 zheng - li shi \u2019 s group reported finding , in one single location , multiple strains of SARS - related coronaviruses with ( between them ) the highest known genetic similarity to SARS one , the virus that caused the 2002 - 04 outbreak ( hu et al . , \n2017 ) . \nthe site was a cave close to kunming , capital of yunnan province . \nthe authors reached two major bat progenitor of SARS one arose through recombination among precursors of these viruses , 2 ) that yunnan was \u201c likely to be the geographical source \u201d of SARS one . \u201c \nsarsr - cov evolution is strongly correlated with their geographical origin , but not host species . \u201d ( \nhu et al . , \n2017 ) as the authors acknowledged , this generated what was subsequently termed a \u2018 mismatch \u2019 ( luk et al . , \n2019 ) . \nthe puzzle consisted of the fact that the 2002 SARS one outbreak commenced in guangzhou , jumped from civets to humans ) . \nguangzhou is 1,200 km south east of the cave near kunming where the spillover to humans would have been predicted from the phylogeographic evidence alone . \naccording to zheng - li shi , in comments made at the time to a chinese online newspaper , this mystery can be resolved : \u201c the paper : is the civet being wronged ? \nshi zhengli : not wronged . \nit is a fact that it spreads the SARS virus , it is the intermediate host , and bats are the under kunming , yunnan . \nI checked the information at that time . \nin 2003 , there was a civet breeding farm in kunming , but there is no more now . \nat that time , the country \u2019 s civet cats were sold in guangdong , mainly for food . \u201d [ \ngoogle translate ] in other words , zheng - li shi had a ready explanation in 2017 ( which is not mentioned in hu et al . , \n2017 ) for how SARS one moved from kunming , yunnan , to the outbreak epicentre which have long been considered the likely intermediary host for SARS one ( wang et al . , \n2006 ) . \npresumably , civets being farmed in kunming became infected via contact with bats . \nsubsequently , ones infected with the direct progenitor of SARS one were then transported to guangdong . \nthe example of SARS one suggests two things . \nfirst , that it is indeed practicable and productive to track bat coronavirus reservoirs down to the microgeographical level of a few kilometres . \nthus , it would not be surprising , since lineage share the same host species ( rhinolophus bats ) , and these bats rarely fly far afield ( lau et al . , \n2010 ) , if the SARS - cov-2 lineage could be similarly tracked . \nsecond , the successful mapping of SARS one and the strong geographical associations often noted in the virology literature for similar bat coronaviruses ( see latinne at al . , \n2020 and also fig . \n3 in boni et al . , \n2020 ) , make it puzzling that coronavirologists have not already analysed SARS - cov-2 and its newfound relatives in provenance of its genome subparts this analysis has so far established that genetic relatedness among the SARS - cov-2 lineage of coronaviruses in their bat reservoir is strongly correlated with sampling location . \nsuch a correlation allows viral genome sequence alone to be used to find the geographic source of any bat virus in the lineage if that is not already known . \napplied to SARS - cov-2 this reasoning locates its last bat ancestor to at or near the mojiang mine . \nthis finding is considerably more than a simple reformulation of the idea that the important or the conclusion of latinne et al . , \n2020 , that SARS - cov-2 might have come from yunnan . \nthis phylogeographic analysis greatly strengthens the weight and precision of this association . \nby showing that the highest related genomes are all nearby and only less related ones far away , the association of the mine with SARS - cov-2 is not a happenstance but part of a general phylogeographic pattern among the SARS - cov-2 lineage . \nthis pattern makes it highly probable that the direct bat precursor virus of SARS - cov-2 came from , at most , mojiang mine , with the mine itself being the epicentre of the probability gradient , i.e . \nthe most likely single spot . \nthe approach used above correlated whole genomes with location . \nA variant of this method is to take into account the fact that different sections of the SARS - cov-2 genome have independent evolutionary histories due to recombination between viruses ( e.g. , boni et al . , \n2020 ; lytras et al . , \n2021 ) . \ndividing up the evolution of the SARS - cov-2 genome and its related coronaviruses into these independently evolving to determining its origin . \nhowever , there are trade - offs . \nbreaking down the genome requires making assumptions about historic recombination breakpoints , and these estimates can introduce errors of their own . \nwhat happens when one does delve down ? \nif one compares the genome of SARS - cov-2 with the other members of the SARS - cov-2 lineage ( including prc31 and the pangolin genomes ) by creating a similarity plot ( this one generated by twitter user babarlelephant ) , an important point becomes immediately clear . \nnone of the viruses currently identified SARS - cov-2 , not even ratg13 ( even though ratg13 is by a considerable way the closest in overall percent similarity ) . \nas the similarity plot shows ( by finding the highest line on the plot ) , some regions of SARS - cov-2 are clearly genetically closer to rmyn02 ( the light blue line ) than to ratg13 ( the red line ) , while for other regions the closest to SARS - cov-2 is rpyn06 ( the black line ) . \nfour separate parts in ORF1 , meanwhile , are closest to prc31 ( the segment ( including the crucial receptor binding domain ( RBD ) is closest to the guangdong pangolin genome ( MP789 ) while another very short segment is closest to raccs203 . \nthe similarity to SARS - cov-2 shown by these latter two segments , however , should be treated with caution . \nthey are short enough that their apparent close relatedness may have arisen through chance ( i.e . \nthey are potential examples of convergent evolution ) and not through having a common ancestor . \nthe key overall point to be learned from the plot of the genome of SARS - cov-2 , the closest known genetic sequence is present either in rmyn02 , rpyn06 , prc31 , or ratg13 . \nthese four viruses are thus the closest relatives of SARS - cov-2 , depending on which part of the genome is examined . \nthis makes SARS - cov-2 a recombinant whose genome is , effectively , a synthesis of each of these different bat viruses . \ngiven that these four viruses are all from the same limited region of central - southern yunnan this is , if anything , a still more convincing demonstration than that this area is the source of SARS - cov-2 . \nthis discussion has so far taken a simple mathematical approach that omits a crucial aspect of the COVID-19 emergence story \u2013 the nature of coronaviral zoonoses . \nA zoonotic emergence of a bat coronavirus into humans requires something unusual . \nmost bat coronaviruses do not infect humans or human cells because they lack a spike protein capable of binding human ACE2 ( or , like MERS , another human receptor ) ( hu et al . , \n2017 ) . \nthe spike protein , therefore , as a special role in triggering emergence ( becker et al . , \n2008 ; ge at al . , \n2013 ) . \nin fact , in 2014 , zheng - li shi and peter daszak were awarded a US NIH grant to test whether \u201c S ( pike ) protein sequences predict spillover potential \u201d as measured by their ability to bind human ACE2 . \ntheir prediction was that spike binding alone predicts emergence , a suggestion originally proposed by kuo et al . \nin 2000 . \nthe inspiration for this approach was their research on the above . \nin the cave near kunming where they found the series of viruses most closely related to SARS one , they also noted that some of these viruses , unusually for bat coronaviruses , had spike proteins that bound human ACE2 ( ge at al . , \n2013 ) . \nexperiments were able to show that these particular spikes enabled whatever bat virus carried them to infect human cells ( menachery et al . , \n2015 ) . \ntheir working hypothesis became that any bat coronavirus with a human compatible spike could switch species \u2013 from the genome ( ge et al . , \n2013 ) . \nA human - compatible spike was both necessary and sufficient for a zoonotic leap . \nthe cave near kunming , therefore contained the nearest relatives of SARS one solely because a subset of them had the right spike to unlock human cells using their ACE2 binding ability . \ncoronaviruses containing this spike then encountered a physical route , via farmed civets , that led to human infections and ultimately the SARS one outbreak ( hu et al . , \n2017 ) . \nthus , once a bind the human ACE2 , the remaining sequences followed , essentially opportunistically . \nthe implication for the emergence of SARS - cov-2 is that , whereas the provenance of each part of the SARS - cov-2 genome is of equal phylogeographic interest , not all coronavirus genome regions are equal in other ways . \nthe most important region of the genome , so far as zoonotic emergence is concerned , is the part that specifies the spike . \ninspecting the similarity plot again we can see that the closest spike found anywhere is , by a large ; and ratg13 , we know , was found in the mojiang mine . \nthe ratg13 spike shares 98 % amino acid identity with SARS - cov-2 . \nhowever , while some researchers have concluded that the spike of ratg13 binds human ACE2 but only moderately well , others have concluded there is negligible binding ( shang et al . , \n2020 ; wrobel et al . , \n2020 ; li Y. et al . , \n2020 ; li and zhang 2021 ; li P. et al . , \n2021 ; liu et al . , \n2021 ; mou et , 2021 ) . \nbut what is much more important than these somewhat inconclusive results is that ( unless SARS - cov-2 was a product of lab enhancement ) we can be fairly certain that the progenitor ( ratg13 - like ) virus which first infected a human , also bound human ACE2 , at least to some degree , and that it was this binding that enabled the spillover . \nfrom this premise we can reconstruct a plausible emergence pathway . \nan ratg13 - like spike , from mojiang or nearby , led the zoonosis . \nit combined rpyn06 and prc31 and these followed in its wake . \nthus , by length of the total genome contributed , rmyn02 , rpyn06 , ratg13 and prc31 were approximately equally important to the rise of SARS - cov-2 . \nhowever , from a zoonotic perspective , the spike region contributed by ratg13 is much the most important . \nit would have catalysed the outbreak and therefore ratg13 , or some close relation , is the best candidate for being present at the pivotal moment : the infection of patient zero . \nthe implications for zoonotic locating the bat progenitor of SARS - cov-2 to the mojiang area of yunnan has major implications for understanding the origin of SARS - cov-2 . \nfirst , it places substantial constraints on natural zoonotic origin possibilities . \nzoonotic origin theories typically assume a proximal source in farmed or smuggled or wild animals . \nthe analysis developed above implies , however , that any zoonotic theory must plausibly accommodate a bat jump in south - central yunnan , much as zheng - li shi hypothesised for SARS one a little further north . \nfor example , a widely discussed zoonotic possibility into wuhan , e.g . \nvia \u201c malayan pangolins illegally imported into guangdong province \u201d ( anderson et al . \n2020 ; lam et al . , \n2020 ) . \nthis pangolin origin possibility is still widely cited , although it has also been the subject of much scientific criticism ( lee et al . , \n2020 ; lytras et al , 2021 ; choo et al . , \n2020 ; frutos et al . , \n2020 ) . \nthe expectation has been that this pangolin reached wuhan from countries like malaysia , cambodia , or laos lee et al . , \n2020 ) . \nour phylogeographic analysis indicates , however , that the pangolin must have acquired its virus from the bat reservoir in yunnan and not in its country of origin or some other part of china . \nso while acquiring the virus in yunnan does not rule out a pangolin as a proximal origin or a zoonosis per se , this analysis does constrain these possibilities very significantly . \nto choose another example , some apparent very early COVID-19 cases have been reported from spain , italy , however , posits that the virus did not ultimately come from europe . \nthirdly , a south - central yunnan origin has implications for the suggestion of chinese scientists that SARS - cov-2 reached china from abroad via frozen food ( zhou and shi , 2021 ) . \nthis idea was apparently taken seriously by WHO investigators but it seems incompatible with a central yunnan origin . \neven if the food came from abroad , the virus contaminating it presumably did not . \nfourth , a zoonosis implies the existence of naturally - occurring intermediate viruses that ought to between ratg13 and SARS - cov-2 ( recently estimated at around 40yrs by lytras et al . , \n2021 and also boni et al . , \n2020 ) . \nthis gap has been partially filled by the discoveries of rmyn02 , rpyn06 and prc31 , which in certain genome regions are intermediate in sequence between ratg13 and SARS - cov-2 . \nnevertheless , even taking these viruses into account , about two thirds of the gap in the putative zoonotic trail remains . \nthese hypothetical naturally - occurring intermediates have not been discovered , it is suggested , because bat coronaviruses andersen et al . , \n2020 ) . \nhowever , a south - central yunnan origin implies that any undersampling pertains specifically to yunnan , since this is where all the other close relatives of SARS - cov-2 have been found . \nis yunnan undersampled ? \nas we have previously summarised , numerous different virology teams extensively sampled in yunnan , especially at the mojiang mine , even before the pandemic struck . \nfor example , zheng - li shi \u2019 s colleagues alone visited the mojiang mine seven times in the years following the 2012 outbreak . \nat least mine looking for coronaviruses prior to the pandemic . \nby their own accounts , WIV researchers alone took thousands of samples and found hundreds of coronaviruses ( ge et al . , \n2016 ; guo et al . , \n2016 ) . \npost - pandemic , AP documented numerous wildlife sampling research projects in china as part of what it called a \u201c hidden hunt for coronavirus origins \u201d especially in bats , including in yunnan . \nthus , massive undersampling at this point in time seems questionable . \nthe discussion above demonstrates that pinpointing a specific the jump from bats requires zoonotic theories to be more specific and precise in terms of host species , viral intermediates , and their expected locations . \nthis specificity is highly valuable . \nit should make every theory both easier to confirm or to refute . \non the other hand , any theory that can not be adapted to include a yunnan origin ought , henceforth , to be considered not credible . \nthe implications for lab escape theories of an origin in south - central yunnan lab origin theories of SARS - cov-2 also should have sequences . \nli - meng yan and colleagues have proposed that SARS - cov-2 is a deliberately released bioweapon . \nthese authors proposed that the backbone of this \u2018 weapon \u2019 was ZC45 and/or ZXC21 . \nhowever , because ratg13 , rmyn02 , rpyn06 and prc31 are , depending on the region of the genome selected , invariably closer to SARS - cov-2 than either of ZC45 or ZXC21 , dr yan \u2019 s formulation of a bioweapon theory can be confidently ruled out . \nthree distinct categories of lab accident theory have been proposed so far . \nthe infection of a researcher on a sample collecting trip . \nthis worker could have infected others when they returned to wuhan . \nfrom the present analysis it can be inferred that any such collecting trip would have been to south / central yunnan . \nconsequently , it may be possible to effectively rule out this possibility if it could be shown that no virologist from wuhan travelled to yunnan province in mid - to - late 2019 . \nA second category of lab origin postulates that ratg13 ( or a similar virus ) was obtained from the mojiang mine or technology - related research purpose . \nthis genetically manipulated or passaged virus then escaped ( kaina , 2020 ; segreto and deigin , 2020 ; sirotkin and sirotkin , 2020 ; DRASTIC , 2021 ) . \nsuch theories are consistent with any phylogeographic findings since any changes from known viruses can , in principle , be explained by lab manipulation or adapted to propose an alternative source of the viral backbone . \ntherefore , an origin close to mojiang is not a major constraint . \nA much greater one is that these lab origin sequences resembling the naturally - occurring viruses rmyn02 , rpyn06 and prc31 are found in SARS - cov-2 . \npresumably this explanation might be that researchers in wuhan had access to another virus , one that combined an ORF1 region that was more similar to these sequences with an ratg13 - like spike . \nthis virus was then modified , perhaps by inserting a furin cleavage site . \nthe expectation would nevertheless be that this hypothetical virus came from south - central yunnan . \nthe third category of lab escape is our mojiang miners passage theory . \nthis is based on , mentioned above , who all became sick in 2012 whilst shovelling bat guano at the mojiang mine ( rahalkar and bahulikar , 2020 ) . \nthese six miners all developed covid-19 - like symptoms and were diagnosed at the time with a probable novel coronavirus . \nthe theory proposes that a ratg13 - like coronavirus ( or mixture of viruses that later recombined into one ) from the mine infected the miners . \nsome of these miners were ill for almost six months . \nour suggestion , therefore , is that the bat virus ( es a passaging - like process ) inside their bodies to become human - adapted . \nsince it is known that numerous medical samples were taken from the miners and many were sent to the wuhan institute of virology , this virus may have escaped when those medical samples were used for research , perhaps to culture the virus or to manipulate it . \nwe favour this theory because it explains numerous otherwise puzzling features of SARS - cov-2 . \nthese features are ( 1 ) the high improbability of a zoonotic appearance of a SARS - related coronavirus in wuhan ; of the virus to humans ( piplani et al . , \n2021 ; van dorp et al . , \n2020 ; zhan et al , 2020 ) ; ( 3 ) a miner \u2019 s passage predicts a single zoonotic jump to humans [ which fits the data on early human sequences ( bloom , 2021 ) ] and which is inconsistent with most viral zoonoses , which typically feature multiple jumps into humans ; ( 4 ) a miner - derived virus also explains the proclivity of SARS - cov-2 for human lungs , which is a characteristic ) the theory can also explain the extensive attempts to deny or obscure research occurring at the WIV ( see also the zhou P. et al . , \n2020a addendum ) . \nthe mojiang miners hypothesis even has an evolutionary explanation for the infamous furin cleavage site . \nhowever , none of this precludes the possibility that the miner - derived virus was also lab - altered . \nsince the theory specifically postulates that patient zero was a mojiang miner who acquired one or more SARS - cov-2 - related viruses directly from the bats in the mine , the miners passaging lineage revealed above . \nindeed , it is an explicit prediction of the mojiang miner passage theory that SARS - cov-2 is composed of viruses originating there . \nconsequently , a miner passage origin is also consistent with SARS - cov-2 being a mosaic of rmyn02 , rpyn06 , prc31 and ratg13 since , as the phylogeography shows , these viruses , or their close relatives , could have been present in the mine when the miners fell ill . \nA miner passage is therefore not just compatible with but greatly strengthened by all the new evidence from pandemic began . \nA phylogeographic approach to the SARS - cov-2 lineage thus provides a striking result on several fronts . \nlab origin theories can readily account for a south / central yunnan origin , since the mojiang mine is already their starting point . \nbut while the various lab leak theories have their differing explanations ( evolution in the miners / genetic engineering / lab passaging ) for how ratg13 ( or similar viruses ) might have given rise to SARS - cov-2 , a natural zoonotic origin relies on evolution in wild ( or at least semi - natural ) settings and this intermediate viruses . \nit is therefore a highly problematic state of affairs for all zoonotic theories that , 1 ) no viruses with an overrall similarity higher than ratg13 have been found and , 2 ) that no intermediate viruses from potential intermediate hosts have been found . \nwe can now conclude , however , that yunnan is the place where it should have succeeded . \nto sample or not to sample if a bona fide closer relative of SARS - cov-2 were found tomorrow in a bat far away from south - central yunnan , then have to be rethought and the special significance of south - central yunnan would stand refuted . \none obvious approach is therefore to call for more sampling to test the association . \nyunnan would be the logical focal point of this search . \nhowever , there is a clear problem with further sampling . \nit is likely that the SARS one pandemic originated from a bat virus from yunnan that had evolved the ability to infect humans . \nthe 2012 miner outbreak likewise exemplified the risks of close contact with bat coronaviruses . \nfurthermore , the case , already strong , that SARS - cov-2 ultimately resulted from virus sampling . \nso the paradox is rather acute . \nwhat or who will ensure that future sampling is conducted with far greater prudence than virologists have so far mustered ? \nthere is one further crucial issue . \nto date , both the wuhan institute of virology and the ecohealth alliance ( EHA ) in new york have refused requests by congress and others , to allow public access to their existing coronavirus samples and their viral databases . \nthese may hold but if publicly - funded virologists will not share the samples they already have , and are apparently unwilling to face the conclusions public access might entail , why should anyone reward them to collect more ? \nindeed , how can research into the origins of COVID-19 meaningfully proceed if virologists will neither share their data nor follow where it leads when they do ? \nthe abject failure of the WHO and also of established science , in china and elsewhere , to genuinely investigate the origin question can thus be explained . \nthe problem this article and the creative approaches of members of DRASTIC , and others , have shown , there is plenty of valuable data waiting to be brought forth . \nrather , the obstacle is simply a deep and broad fear on the part of the scientific establishment that the trail might lead to a lab leak . \nthe lack of outrage , or even concern , among the rank and file of the scientific community at the flagrant obstructionism of the WIV and the EHA demonstrates the extent of this fear as clearly problem is that academic science is enmeshed in a wider transnational pandemic virus industrial complex ( PVIC ) that has sought to suppress lab origin theories and within which the WIV and the EHA are just minor cogs . \nthe important consequence of this is that outbreak origin investigations are always challenging . \nthey require people who are expert but are either not conflicted or who have demonstrated their independence . \nconsequently , the best data and analysis on the origin of SARS - cov-2 will continue to come , we predict , mainly from acknowledgements : the authors are deeply grateful to francisco de asis , babarlelephant , and the other reviewers of this article for their generous assistance and numerous helpful suggestions . \nandersen , K.

'' \nthe report states that the agencies judged the scientifically invalid claims , '' adding that its ` ` proponents are suspected of spreading disinformation .

'' \nthe report does state that , among its contributing agencies , four ` ` assess with low confidence '' that the virus probably sprung from natural sources ; one finds with ` ` moderate confidence '' that the pandemic ` ` most likely '' resulted from a laboratory incident , and theories . \nthe report does n't link specific agencies to those findings , however . \nthe intelligence services also reproach the chinese government for hindering international investigations of COVID-19 's origins , in part by refusing to share information about WIV research or its own findings about the early course of the disease in wuhan . \n` ` these actions reflect , in part , china 's government 's own uncertainty about where an investigation could lead , '' the U.S. report says , ` ` as well as its frustration the international community is on china . '' \nthe services are generally dismissive of what it calls ` ` open - source '' theories of the pandemic 's origin , typically passed around on social media . \n` ` these theories generally do not provide diagnostic information on COVID-19 origins , and in some cases are not supported by the information available to us .

then it took nearly a month for democratic and republican leadership to agree on a resolution governing the organization of the upper chamber , which further delayed committee work . \nand second

development and the small business administration , departments that will be key to some of biden 's top priorities and the implementation of his $ 1.9 trillion coronavirus aid bill , if it 's passed into law later this month . \nand the delay in confirming top posts also means a delay in confirming and seating deputy secretaries and undersecretaries , who are often in charge of the nitty gritty in implementing major policy . \nshalala noted , for instance , the centers for on how insurers should cover coronavirus costs and implementation on aspects of the COVID-19 aid bill , and currently only has an acting administrator . \nshe also noted HHS has deputies who oversee everything from refugee resettlement to child care programs . \nand tanden 's withdrawal tuesday raises further questions about the biden administration 's budget process . \nthe white house has yet to offer a timeline for releasing its budget , citing the transition delays and a lack of cooperation from the trump administration . \nthat puts them behind most recent presidents to congress by the end of february , though trump didn \u2019 t submit his until mid - march . \nthe biden administration has not been completely hamstrung by the slow pace of confirmations , however . \nthe white house has issued a number of executive orders outlining policy reviews and changes that are underway at federal departments , and civil servants are working through key policy decisions , even without senate - confirmed leadership in place . \nfor instance , while biden \u2019 s nominee to head the department of education , miguel cardona , was , the department 's acting head last month put out guidelines requiring states to administer standardized tests despite the pandemic . \nand stier noted that the biden administration has installed hundreds of non - senate - confirmed staff across the federal government , helping to provide guidance even without department heads in place . \nbiden himself swore in more than 1,100 non - senate - confirmed staff throughout the federal government on the first day of his presidency , a number stier said was unprecedented . \n` ` it ameliorates the problem in

\nis there somewhere where there \u2019 s a map ? \ndo the county commissioners have that , does the city planner have that ? \u201d \nthe reaction to his questions : laughter at \u2019 and ready , others scrambling plenty of broadband money is already heading out the door even before the infrastructure grants start flowing . \ncities and states can draw broadband money from their shares of a $ 350 billion fund created by march \u2019 s pandemic relief package , as well as a $ 10 billion capital projects fund , both run out of the treasury department . \nother pandemic relief efforts supporting digital infrastructure include a $ 980 million commerce department fund aimed at bolstering connectivity for american indian tribes and another gear . \nexactly how much of this money would go to broadband \u2014 and other connectivity fixes , such as cell towers \u2014 is in flux and varies by state . \ncalifornia has created a $ 6 billion broadband plan , while virginia is eyeing $ 700 million , tennessee $ 500 million and north carolina $ 1.2 billion . \nstates from arizona to wisconsin to maine are pursuing plans to spend at least $ 100 million apiece . \nindividual cities have seized the potential too , such as brownsville , texas , lay fiber . \nin ohio , republican gov . \nmike dewine signed a law this summer creating a broadband program aimed at providing $ 20 million in state money to go along with the expected federal dollars . \nsome states have an advantage , however : they \u2019 re armed with more accurate data about where to target the windfall . \ngeorgia worked to identify broadband gaps during the past three years , motivated by both the shoddy federal data and a hope to get money from former president donald trump \u2019 s improved maps went online last year just as the state needed those details : coverage information down to the address , partly thanks to deal - making with local internet service providers . \nduring covid lockdowns , georgia was able to identify where schoolchildren couldn \u2019 t participate in remote learning due to lack of at - home broadband . \nleaders now see those early investments as fortuitous , given the $ 2.4 billion the state received in its first tranche of pandemic relief money \u2014 $ 300 million of which will go to broadband infrastructure . \u2019 \nre ready , \u201d said mike curtis , director of planning and strategy in the georgia technology authority . \u201c \nwe have everything in place \u2014 we have the vendors in place , we have the data in place , we have the providers in place . \nand we \u2019 ve got the money . \u201d \nhe added : \u201c we \u2019 re in graduate school . \nsome of these states , they \u2019 re in elementary , maybe pre - K. \u201d but the unreadiness of other states is unsettling policymakers who hope to strict requirements govern what data states can use to target their pandemic relief dollars . \u201c \nI am worried that there \u2019 s different standards in different states , \u201d said former FCC commissioner mike O \u2019 rielly , a republican who left the agency last year . \nhe projected that assembling better data could take two years , but said state officials wo n't wait to start spending . \u201c \nif they \u2019 ve got the chance , they \u2019 re going to try to do it . \u201d \nin ohio \u2019 s with speed test data from a company called ookla \u2014 showing that at least 340,000 households in eastern ohio had no home broadband connections . ( \nin contrast , the FCC estimates that at most 328,000 households in the entire state have connections too slow to fit its definition of broadband . ) \nbut ookla data is also far from authoritative , and isherwood said the burden shouldn \u2019 t be on communities to figure out the scope of the problem . \nthe 200 or so residents of the county \u2019 s rural from frontier communications that mayor gary goosman said falls well below the federal broadband threshold . \nwhen the amesville library set up a wi - fi hot spot in the town center , people sat in their cars downloading homework assignments and filing unemployment paperwork , the mayor recalled . \nfrontier spokesperson erin kurtz said the ISP , which emerged from bankruptcy in april , is \u201c investing heavily to build fiber and bring lightning - fast broadband to communities across the country , many in underserved areas . \u201d \nbut for now , the mayor said , \u2014 difficult for many in the high - poverty area to afford . \u201c \nerroneous \u201d coverage estimates have prevented him from obtaining federal funding in years past , he added . \u201c \nwe \u2019 ve always known we were behind the curve in terms of speeds and availability , but that really jumped in the last year , \u201d goosman said . \u201c \nin amesville , cellphones don \u2019 t work . \u201d \nand then came 2021 , dangling its broadband dollars . \nmore than 56 percent of athens county voted for biden , who repeatedly invoked its importance this year . \neven the telecom industry , which is set to reap some of these subsidies , fears charging ahead without adequate information . \none of its main fears is \u201c overbuilding \u201d \u2014 the risk that inaccurate coverage data could lead to the government subsidizing new internet providers that compete with established carriers . \u201c \nwith billions of dollars flowing before the FCC \u2019 s broadband data collection is complete , yes , there is anxiety about that \u2014 that the dollars will not be targeted to halley , who represents isps like AT & T and verizon as general counsel for the trade group ustelecom . \u201c \nthere \u2019 s no doubt that spending right now is based on incomplete data , and that \u2019 s not ideal . \u201d \nthe telecom industry is a big reason the existing data is so spotty , however , given the wariness among isps to share proprietary information . \nthe nation \u2019 s central repository of broadband maps has been hosted since 2018 at the FCC , a telecom regulator that has limited the FCC uses for those maps has drawn widespread criticism for overestimating coverage : under the forms that the carriers submit to the agency , if one household has internet , its entire census block is considered covered . \nnationally , this means we still don \u2019 t know how many people need assistance , more than a decade after the federal government began releasing national broadband maps . \nthe official FCC figures say more than 14 million households nationwide are unconnected , lacking at - home broadband speeds of at least 25 megabits per second for uploads . ( \nthe FCC \u2019 s current democratic leadership says this speed definition should be much higher ) . \nbut the true figure is closer to 42 million households , according to broadbandnow , a consumer - centric website launched in 2014 that works with isps to get more detailed data about pricing and coverage , while allowing providers to advertise on its platform . \nothers have also jumped in to supplement the FCC maps . \nmicrosoft , ookla and M - lab have sketched out coverage estimates using speed tests and other methods sense , as has analysis from the pew research center . \nthe biden administration assembled these varying datasets into an interactive map this summer while pitching its infrastructure plan , allowing people to compare coverage information with other factors like poverty level . \nbut the tool doesn \u2019 t contain any authoritative new data , even if it showcases how sharply the existing estimates vary . \nthe treasury department said it intentionally lets communities decide how to parse out the money . \nmany states simply use the old FCC maps as a baseline organization next century cities reported in may . \nalthough some advocates welcome the leeway \u2014 saying local leaders are best positioned to identify broadband shortfalls \u2014 others worry about the political risks of sloppy spending . \u201c \nI have a real fear that there are going to be certain communities that are going to be spending money on things with unvetted advice , \u201d said joshua edmonds , the director of digital inclusion for detroit , during a knight foundation event this summer . \nin an interview , he urged communities to create \u201c local communities need to be stepping up . \u2026 \nthat \u2019 s not happening . \ninstead what we \u2019 re getting is this war over datasets , and you know this \u2014 whoever has the best datasets calls the shots . \u201d \none hard truth is that washington mostly succeeded at creating a plan to fix its mapping woes \u2014 but did so too late to direct 2021 \u2019 s flood of money . \nafter years of frustration , congress passed bipartisan legislation in february 2020 requiring the FCC to collect more accurate mapping pilot by ustelecom . \nimplementing this law happened in slow motion over the nearly two years since . \nthe FCC finally got $ 98 million for the effort last december . \nA month later , rosenworcel became acting chair and got to work \u2014 assembling a data task force , hiring an IT vendor , asking consumers and industry for feedback , and offering an initial wireless coverage map with data from the largest providers . \nbut many people still don \u2019 t expect authoritative maps until well into 2022 , something . \nexperts say obtaining detailed coverage data could be a prerequisite for cracking the digital divide \u2014 and that better data , as in georgia , could mean more effective lobbying for aid . \u201c \neach state is going to want to position themselves so they can maximize the amount of dollars they can get , \u201d said eric frank , chief executive of a company called lightbox , which transformed its expertise in crunching reams of real estate data to help build georgia \u2019 s granular internet maps . \nfrank insists nationwide simple scaling up of what the company already did \u2014 and allow government officials to easily offer customized versions with \u201c data layers \u201d to boost analyses . \nlightbox is eager for a larger role in that effort : this month , the company challenged the FCC 's decision to award a nearly $ 45 million mapping contract to a rival company , a dispute that could mean months of delay . \nrosenworcel has suggested congress may need to intervene to speed the process . \ntrying to make do in disconnected areas such the sense of urgency tends to outweigh any squabbling over targeting investments . \nliz shaw , who lives just outside amesville , reached her breaking point four years ago , when slow , unreliable internet service foiled her attempts to order items for the baby shower of her first grandchild . \nthe page \u201c just kept spinning out , \u201d she said . \u201c \nI kept

two years , targeting prominent republicans and conservatives and their families on the streets and in their own homes . \nbut the fact is that trump lawyers only scratched the surface of waters \u2019 divisive and destabilizing diatribes . \nI first began covering \u201c turbulent waters \u201d in the early 1990s as an editorial writer and columnist at the los angeles daily news . \nlet me

spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice and a lot of alienation and frustration , \u201d and coddled crips and bloods gang members \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with whom she performed the electric slide as

their funky little store , but , b - tch , I got a job up and down your market or your little chop suey ass will be a target juice with the people , that \u2019 s what the boy got \u2026 or we \u2019 ll burn your store right down to a crisp . \nwaters told the L.A. times in may 1992 that \u201c riot is the voice of the unheard . \u201d \nshe openly embraced the term \u201c insurrection \u201d as a substitute for \u201c riot \u201d in a 1992 interview with katie couric . \nA quarter - century later , in an anniversary interview with the huffington post insurrection \u201d to celebrate the

not increasing taxes on ordinary americans . \nthe supposed targets are always billionaires , wall street , or more broadly , \u201c the rich . \u201d \nrecent proposals from progressive politicians use the generic term \u201c wealth tax \u201d to drive their point . \nprogressives may believe that cloaking tax schemes in the language of envy may help sell their proposals , but anyone who

here is \u201c unrealized , \u201d about which there are two critical dimensions to note . \nfirst , the value of an asset can not be accurately assessed until there is a real transaction . \nanything prior to that is a mere projected value \u2014 what someone thinks will end up being the actual value . \nsecond , if the projected value of an asset \u2014 your home , for example , mean you magically have more money in the bank . \nthat gain exists only on paper \u2014 that is , it is unrealized . \nthe value of assets only becomes real once they are sold \u2014 when the gain is realized . \nthe same goes for stocks , which data shows are owned by more than half of all americans , with 80 million to 100 million of us owning 401 ( k ) saving and investing plans . \nbut yet , some politicians want to tax those \u201c gains \u201d as if regime would force people to pay taxes regardless . \nso if the projected value of your home rises , you would be taxed on that perceived rise , even as your income remains the same , or possibly goes down . \nwealth taxes would force people who own certain assets like stocks and other similar assets to sell them just to pay the taxes . \nthat reduces people \u2019 s nest eggs \u2014 money that they plan to use for retirement or for a rainy day . \nand for the assets that remain go down in value as stocks and other assets are devalued through forced sales . \nand the economic impact will be exponentially worse given the effect on small businesses . \neveryone , from the struggling sole proprietorship fighting to survive in the era of COVID-19 to mom - and - pop retailers , will find themselves in the IRS \u2019 s crosshairs . \nit may surprise some to know that 99 % of U.S. businesses are small , and that 120 million americans

the general population and have seen some positive growth , especially pre - pandemic , despite facing unique challenges that include access to capital . \nthese businesses are key to wealth and job creation , especially in the communities where they are located . \nbut small businesses are assets , after all , meaning that they will become easy prey for bureaucrats eager to fulfill their mission of lining government coffers to pay for the value of the small business rises \u2014 again , on paper \u2014 owners would be forced to find ways to pay for these new , punitive taxes , undoubtedly leading to significant job losses . \nbut even workers who don \u2019 t lose their jobs will feel the impact directly . \nthe american action forum analyzed so - called wealth taxes from two of their leading champions , sens . \nelizabeth warren and bernie sanders . \nthe analysis found workers would be hit with $ 1.2 trillion in lost earnings over the first 10 years that same time span , bernie sanders \u2019 version would cost workers $ 1.6 trillion in lost earnings . \nAAF shows that workers would essentially pay \u201c an effective tax of 63 cents on workers for every dollar the

convened mission to wuhan . \nboard of governors professor of chemistry and chemical biology at rutgers university , dr. richard H. ebright , phd , is also laboratory director at the project leader on two national institutes of health research grants . \ndr. richard ebright received his AB in biology and his phd in microbiology and molecular genetics from harvard university . \nhe has more than one hundred sixty publications and more than forty issued and pending patents . \nhe is member of the american academy of arts and sciences , and a fellow of the american association for advancement of science , the american academy of microbiology , and the infectious diseases society of america . \ndr. ebright is a member of the the antimicrobial resistance committee of the infectious diseases society of america . \nhe is also been a member of the working group on pathogen security of the state of new jersey , and the controlling dangerous pathogens project of the center for international security studies . \nhe was a founding member of the cambridge working group , which advocated for biosafety , biosecurity , and risk -

china wuhan collaborative team : exclusive chinese field work , lack of complete access to lab installations or databases , consensus process in report making \u2026 A credible investigation would have had terms of reference that : 1 ) acknowledged the possibility of laboratory origin , 2 ) ensured access of investigators to facilities at the wuhan laboratories that handle bat SARS - related coronaviruses , 3 ) enabled collection of evidence , not mere meet - and - greet photo - ops , 4 ) authorized an investigation of months , not mere days . \nand 5 ) A credible investigation also would have had conflict - of - interest - free investigators , not persons who were subjects of the research and/or closely associated with subjects of the investigation . \nyou have said several times that this WHO mission was literally \u201c a charade \u201d . \nyes , its members were willing \u2013 and , in at least one the pre - negotiated \u201c terms of reference \u201d for the WHO study did not even acknowledge the possibility of a laboratory origin of the virus and did not even mention the wuhan institute of virology ( WIV ) , the wuhan center for disease control ( CDC ) or the wuhan institute of biological products . \nregarding the inspection personnel , at least one member of the WHO mission team , ecohealth alliance president dr. peter daszak , seems to have conflicts of interest that should have disqualified him from being part of an pandemic . \nyes . \ndaszak was the contractor who funded the laboratory at WIV that potentially was the source of the virus ( with subcontracts from $ 200 million from the US department of state and $ 7 million from the US national institutes of health ) , and he was a collaborator and co - author on research projects at the laboratory . \nthe open letter also lists the elements of \u201c what a full investigation should look like \u201d . \nso again , dr. ebright , if you where in charge of a origins of the pandemic : what would you like to see first ? \nwhat kind of questions would you ask and to who ? \nA credible forensic investigation would require access to records , samples , personnel , and facilities at WIV , the wuhan CDC and the wuhan institute of biological products . \nit would entail inspection of electronic and paper records , inspection of freezer and refrigerator samples , environmental sampling of facilities , and confidential interviews with personnel \u2013 including previous and current construction , maintenance , janitorial , disposal , security personnel . \nwhenever asked if this virus could have leaked from the wuhan institute of virology , your answer has been : \u201c yes ( \u2026 ) this can not and should not be dismissed \u201d . \nA study on COVID origin of dr. steven quay , another signer of the open letter , calculates the lab hypotheses to be a 99.8 % probability . \nat this point in time , there is no secure basis to assign relative probabilities to the natural - accident hypothesis and the laboratory - accident hypothesis . \nbut given the fact what chance do you give for a natural zoonotic origin of this pandemic ? \nat this point in time , all scientific data related to the genome sequence of SARS - cov-2 and the epidemiology of COVID-19 are equally consistent with a natural - accident origin or a laboratory - accident origin . \nwhat would you say to the scientist who declined to comment on the open letter because it does not come from virologists ? \nthere were virologists among the signers of the open letter . \nthere even were coronavirologists among the signers of the open letter . \non the planet . \nnot just virologists . \ndr. ebright , you are a microbiologist and molecular biologist , what light can you shed on this matter from your fields of expertise ? \nmicrobiologists and molecular biologists are as qualified as virologists to assess the relevant science and science policies . \nvirology is a subset , not a superset , of microbiology and molecular biology . \nthe sequencing , sequence analysis , cell culture , animal - infection studies , and other laboratory procedures used by virologists are not materially different from the procedures used I guess that is why the second point of the open letter research proposal is precisely to create a multidisciplinary team . \nit is crucial that any team reviewing the issues include not only research scientists , but also biosafety , biosecurity , and science policy specialists . \nwhat biological evidence regarding the structure and behaviour of SARS - cov-2 points to a pure zoonosis ? \nand what to the lab theory ? \nthe genome sequence of the outbreak virus indicates that its progenitor was either the horseshoe - bat coronavirus ratg13 , or a closely related wuhan institute of virology in 2013 from a horseshoe - bat colony in a mine in yunnan province , where miners had died from a SARS - like pneumonia in 2012 , was partly sequenced by WIV in 2013 - 2016 , was fully sequenced by WIV in 2018 - 2019 , and was published by WIV in 2020 . \nbat coronaviruses are present in nature in multiple parts of china . \ntherefore , the first human infection could have occurred as a natural accident , with a virus passing from a bat to a human , possibly through another animal . \nthe first entry of the SARS virus into the human population occurred as a natural accident in a rural part of guangdong province in 2002 . \nbut bat coronaviruses are also collected and studied by laboratories in multiple parts of china , including the wuhan institute of virology . \ntherefore , the first human infection also could have occurred as a laboratory accident , with a virus accidentally infecting a field collection staffer , a field survey staffer , or a laboratory staffer , followed by transmission from the staffer to the for this . \nthe second , third , fourth and fifth entries of the SARS virus into human populations occurred as a laboratory accident in singapore in 2003 , a laboratory accident in taipei in 2003 , and two separate laboratory accidents in beijing in 2004 . \nso for you there is still a fifty - fifty chance ? \nat this point in time , there is no secure basis to assign relative probabilities to the natural - accident hypothesis and the laboratory - accident hypothesis . \nnevertheless , there are three lines of circumstantial evidence that are worth in wuhan , a city of 11 million persons that does not contain horseshoe - bat colonies , that is tens of kilometers from , and that is outside the flight range of , the nearest known horseshoe - bat colonies . \nfurthermore , the outbreak occurred at a time of year when horseshoe bats are in hibernation and do not leave colonies second , the outbreak occurred in wuhan , on the doorstep of the laboratory that conducts the world \u2019 s largest research project on horseshoe bat viruses , that has the world \u2019 s that possessed and worked with the world \u2019 s closest sequenced relative of the outbreak virus . \nthe laboratory actively searched for new horseshoe - bat viruses in horseshoe - bat colonies in caves in remote rural areas in yunnan province , brought those new horseshoe - bat viruses to wuhan , and then mass - produced , genetically manipulated , and studied those new horseshoe - bat viruses , year - round , inside wuhan . \nA remarkable coincidence . \nthe last one ? \nthird , the bat - SARS - related - coronavirus projects at the wuhan institute of virology used personal protective equipment ( usually just gloves ; standards ( usually just biosafety level 2 ) that would pose very high risk of infection of field - collection , field - survey , or laboratory staff upon contact with a virus having the transmission properties of SARS - cov-2 . \nthe lab leak hypotheses , as raised in the open letter , should address four possible scenarios that do not imply genetic manipulation in a gain - of - function ( gof ) experiment . \nbut this chance can not be excluded . \ndr. ebright , when the pandemic started you declared : \u201c there \u2019 s absolutely nothing in the the virus was engineered \u201d . \nwould you reassert this today ? \nthe genome sequence of this virus shows no signatures of human manipulation . \nbut dr. ralph baric , who is considered the US leading expert in coronavirus , so he probably is the world one , says that is possible to engineer a virus in a lab without leaving a trace of the manipulation . \nthe fact that the genome sequence of this virus shows no signatures of human manipulation rules out the kinds of gain - of - function ( gof ) research that rule out kinds of gof research that do not leave signatures . \nthe chance that cov-2 is a gof virus does not imply that the leak could have occurred during a bioweapons program . \nopen letter signatories do not address this scenario , that you firmly exclude . \nbe that as it may , dr. ebright , as a longstanding opponent of biological weapons proliferation ( nature : jan. 24/02 & jan. 15/12 ) and founding member of the harvard \u201c cambridge working group consensus statement on the creation of potential pandemic pathogens current crisis demand a new debate and moratorium on these highly risky experiments , and this these time with a more international engagement ? \nwhat went wrong for the cambridge working group thesis during the 2014 - 2016 USA official moratorium and deliberative process on gain - of - function research of concern ( gofroc ) ? \nthe director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases ( NIAID ) and the director of the national institutes of health ( NIH ) have systematically thwarted efforts by the white house , the congress , scientists , and science concern and even to require risk - benefit review for projects involving gof research of concern . \nin 2014 , the obama white house implemented a \u201c pause \u201d in federal funding for gof research of concern . \nhowever , the document announcing the pause stated in a footnote that : \u201c an exception from pause may be obtained if head of funding agency determines research is urgently necessary to protect public health or national security \u201d . \nunfortunately , the NIAID director and the NIH director exploited this loophole to issue exemptions to projects exempted research was \u201c urgently necessary to protect public health or national security \u201d \u2013 thereby nullifying the pause . \nin 2017 , the trump administration announced a potential pandemic pathogens control and oversight ( P3CO ) framework that implemented a requirement for risk - benefit review of gof research of concern . \nhowever , the P3CO framework relies on the funding agency to flag and forward proposals for risk - benefit review . \nunfortunately , the NIAID director and the NIH director have declined to flag and forward proposals for risk - benefit review , thereby nullifying the with ppps have won all the debates of the last decade . \nbut I wonder why some of its most prestigious critics are keeping now such a low profile , when not a thunderous silence . \nand I am thinking of one of the leading organizers of the cambridge working group : the harvard epidemiologist dr. marc lipsitch , who in 2018 was still warning that influenza gof studies could provoke a pandemic on a scale never seen before . \nthe silence of some former leaders of the cambridge working group has been way , reading the cited dr. lipsitch paper that I came to know that perhaps the first experimental effort to create a PPP in a lab was the 2005 study titled : \u201c characterization of the reconstructed 1918 spanish influenza pandemic virus \u201d . \ndr. lipsitch wondered about it : \u201c whether it was wise to construct a virus that was historically associated with the worst pandemic in modern history \u201d . \ndo you remember this concrete gof study ? \nare you aware , fifteen years after , of any positive outcome of : was it wise to do it ? \nI consistently have stated that : \u201c this was research that should not have been performed \u201d ( NYT : oct. 05/05 & jan. 29/06 ) . \nand no , the work has not yielded information useful for preventing pandemics or responding to pandemics . \ndrs . \nimperiale and casadevall , both cambridge work group board members , echoed last summer : \u201c most experts who have been studying and discussing preparedness agree that the source of the pathogen does not significantly change the nature , dr. ebright , or maybe the outcome of knowing cov-2 origin could have saved lives ? \nunderstanding the origin of SARS - cov-2 is not crucial for responding to the present pandemic . \nbut it is crucial \u2013 absolutely crucial \u2013 for preventing future pandemics . \nregarding prevention , it was precisely dr. peter daszak , with a renewed grant from the NIH , now to target deadly viruses in south asia , who stated in august 2020 : \u201c we \u2019 re going to work in remote parts of malaysia and thailand to get to pandemic is going to start \u201d . \nnow , though dr. daszak is not openly cited in the march 4 open letter , he is clearly the WHO team member with a more biased vision and unresolved conflict of interest when it comes to inspecting a possible leak in the wuhan institute of virology . \nso going back : if the origin of covid-19 was a lab accident , gof , or in between , this would change the narrative of the whole pandemic , and so the measures that should be taken for instance , keeping crackpot scientists far away from deadly viruses . \nam I wrong ? \nyou are not wrong . \nthank you for your attention , dr. ebright . \nif this article was useful to you please consider sharing it with your networks . \n"}, {"id": 60, "body": "while right -

\nas I reported in this column in april , the subjects of my FOIA request ( nick fuentes and lauren witzke ) have faced repeated obstacles to traveling by air since the beginning of the year . \ntheir plight is part of what I believe is a clearly coordinated campaign of discrimination by big government and remember : multimedia entrepreneur nick fuentes has been banned by all the usual big tech suspects ( most recently by twitter last week after the anti - defamation league published a hit piece ) , along with livestream service dlive , coinbase and every payment processor for his forceful advocacy of populism , an end to mass migration and protection of the nuclear family . \nformer delaware GOP senate candidate lauren witzke ( banned from twitter for calling a pedophilia - flirting transgender activist \u201c demonic \u201d ) had her wells fargo account shut down just last U.S. capitol rally for former president donald trump , but neither had entered the building . \nneither has been charged with any crimes . \nboth were peacefully exercising their first amendment rights . \nyet , president joe biden \u2019 s TSA and multiple airlines told fuentes he no longer has \u201c clearance \u201d to fly ; witzke can not check into flights online , is swabbed for explosives and has \u201c secondary security screening selection \u201d marked on her tickets . \nmy FOIA request would help unearth clues as to the criteria for on secret lists and tyrannically classifying them as \u201c security \u201d threats . \nwitzke called out the feds \u2019 information lockdown for the bribery that it is : \u201c the full force of the federal government is trying to extort ordinary americans who just want to know the truth . \nWHY are they persecuting us ? \u201d \nlaura loomer , another early and repeated victim of big government / big tech abuse , also weighed in : \u201c not only are they trying to extort people for wanting to know the truth , but they lawyers requests to find out why the FBI has illegally red flagged me \u201d and prevented her unilaterally from owning firearms . \u201c \nthe federal government is illegally extorting americans and they are abusing their power to politically persecute and target political opposition . \u201d \nthe rest of the deep - pocketed corporate media remains stubbornly uninterested in freeing the truth on behalf of persecuted dissidents . \nit \u2019 s not a newsflash , but it bears repeating : the fourth estate is not a neutral actor , but an active collaborator with the swamp and @ \n"}, {"id": 62, "body": "in china there is a popular joke about the southern city of guangzhou ( canton ) . \nA visiting space alien , curious to learn about chinese customs , tours its various provinces . \narriving in guangzhou the alien asks the locals what their interests are . \nthe cantonese oblige their guest by putting the alien in a soup pot and eating it . \nthis joke hinges on the cantonese fondness for cooking with unusual species , many obtained from far away . \nthis feature of canton \u2019 s cuisine was implicated in the original SARS ( severe acquired respiratory began in guangzhou . \nit is thought that the virus arrived there with palm civets imported for speciality dishes ( wang et al . , \n2005 ) . \nbut this culinary connection also marks a defining difference between the first SARS coronavirus pandemic and the current one . \nthe COVID-19 ( SARS - cov-2 ) pandemic began in wuhan , but wuhan was considered a comparatively unlikely location for a natural ( zoonotic ) coronavirus spillover ( yu et al . , \n2019 ) . \nit has no cultural or geographic or climatic predisposing factors . \nfor bats are not abundant in wuhan and hubei province has few bat coronaviruses compared to hotspots like yunnan and guangdong ( yu et al . , \n2019 ) . \nunlike canton , wuhan is not famous for exotic fare . \nnor is wuhan near animal smuggling and trading origins ( li et al . \n2019 ) . \nit was for this reason that researchers from the wuhan institute of virology ( the WIV ) , which is the prime suspect in the various lab leak theories , mostly had to travel thousands of kilometres et al . , \n2019 ) . \nfurthermore , when WIV researchers needed to study a chinese population that was not routinely exposed to bat coronaviruses ( as a control group ) , they chose wuhan residents ( wang et al . \n2018 ; li et al . \n2019 ) . \nit is consequently a mystery , if SARS - cov-2 does have a zoonotic origin , why COVID-19 should have emerged where it did . \nas zheng - li shi , head of coronavirus research at the WIV told scientific american , in march 2020 : \u201c thing to happen in wuhan , in central china \u201d . \nwhat is the probability of a natural zoonotic coronavirus outbreak starting in wuhan ? \nit is possible , and potentially helpful , to put numbers on zheng - li shi \u2019 s surprise . \nnumbers can more precisely show the incongruity of an outbreak occurring in wuhan . \nbut before using them it is important to specify the assumptions required so that these numbers can be treated with appropriate caution . \nsuch a calculation requires that we set aside momentarily all the varied , , like those mentioned above , that may make certain locations or populations less or more likely to originate a pandemic . ( \nfor a broader discussion of these factors see e.g . \ngraham et al . , \n2013 ) given these proviso \u2019 s , and knowing that ( 1 ) bats and other animals which harbour coronaviruses are found practically all over the world , and ( 2 ) that the population of wuhan is 11 million , and that ( 3 ) the global population is 7 billion , we can epicentre of a natural zoonotic coronavirus pandemic : the chance of a person from wuhan being patient zero is approximately 630 - 1 . \ntherefore , if we were zheng - li shi , we would have \u201c never expected \u201d a natural zoonotic outbreak in wuhan either . \nimagine her surprise , and that of her colleagues when , in december 2019 , they learned of a local coronavirus outbreak . \nthey ( and other researchers ) travel all over the world , and not just china , looking for coronaviruses yet a pandemic breaks out . \nit truly is , very , very , unlikely that a natural zoonotic pandemic would start in wuhan . \nyet no commentator on the outbreak seems to have properly acknowledged the true scale of this improbability . \nthe second coincidence is an evolutionary coincidence but there is , in fact , a second coincidence regarding the origin of the COVID19 pandemic . \nthis coincidence has seemingly been entirely disregarded ; but it too points strongly to a lab origin . \nthe underlying logic is quite simple and it has to do with \u2019 s laboratory at the WIV is a world centre of coronavirus research . \nthis has been mentioned often and is widely known . \nin particular , the wuhan institute of virology is a world - leading site for bat coronavirus collection ( and the virus came from a bat ) . \nbut what has not been foregrounded is that , even within the coronaviruses , zheng - li shi \u2019 s laboratory had , of the 28 relevant coronavirus species , singled out just one of them as their special focus . \nand it is a \u201c SARS - related coronaviruses \u201c ) that broke out in wuhan in 2019 . \nthis , then , is a further curious coincidence : for a pandemic coronavirus ( SARS - cov-2 ) to emerge in wuhan and be a member of the species most studied at the wuhan institute of virology . \nA fuller appreciation of this coincidence requires visualising coronavirus evolution and understanding the research agenda at the WIV . \nthe coronaviruses are divided into four types : alpha- , beta- , gamma- and delta- coronaviruses . \nthese are shown in fig . \n1 tree adapted from a paper by li et al . , \n2020 . ( \nthe print is small and so here is a link to the original figure . ) \nof this phylogenetic tree , only the alpha ( pink ) and beta ( green ) coronaviruses will be considered here . \nthis is because the gamma ( yellow ) and delta ( blue ) coronaviruses are few , not known to infect humans , and therefore questionably relevant . \nas of february 2020 , when li et al . \ncreated this figure , betacoronaviruses . ( \nnote : a species does not precisely equate to single tips on the phylogenetic tree in fig 1 . \nbecause some species have multiple members . ) \nit is important to appreciate , however , that we have no reason to suppose that a pandemic coronavirus could not have emerged from any branch of this phylogenetic tree . \nindeed , the last coronavirus to jump into humans ( before 2019 ) was MERS ( middle east respiratory syndrome ) in 2012 . \nMERS is a betacoronavirus and was an unknown species the green arrow in figure 2 . \nthe original SARS virus was also unknown as a species at the time it emerged as a human pathogen in 2002 . \nthis unpredictability is also apparent from zheng - li shi \u2019 s choice of \u2018 disease X \u2019 . \nin 2018 the WHO announced a discussion list of pandemic priority diseases , which included ebola , rift valley fever , and other viruses . \nalongside these known diseases the WHO asked experts to nominate a presently unknown candidate . \nzheng - li shi proposed that : \u201c disease caused by a novel coronavirus originated from bats \u201d ( jiang and shi 2020 ) . \nin other words , she did not predict any more narrowly than that the next pandemic would be caused by an alpha- or betacoronavirus . \nthe apparently random nature of coronavirus spillovers to humans is also apparent from inspection of figure 3 . \nfigure 3 shows all of the six human coronaviruses identified prior to this pandemic . \nthey are ( from the top of the figure ) : hcov - NL63 , hcov-229e , MERS , SARS , each indicated in figure 3 by green arrows , except for SARS , which is represented by a black arrow . \nwhat figure 3 illustrates is that human coronaviruses are distributed widely across the coronavirus family tree . \nthat is to say , previous spillovers to humans happened at diverse and seemingly random points on the coronavirus tree and have involved both alpha- and betacoronaviruses . \nwith these prior assumptions stated we can then ask the question : where on the tree would one have expected ( prior to the COVID-19 pandemic ) the answer is , if it were a natural or semi - natural spillover ( i.e . \na zoonosis ) \u2013 \u2013 from a random spot on the tree . \nit might have been an alphacoronavirus or a betacoronavirus . \nit might even , like MERS and SARS , be a novel species , since presumably there are still many undiscovered coronavirus species . \nthe crucial point is that the chance of a spillover coming from each species is , as far as anyone knows , seemingly equal . \nso where , phylogenetically speaking , did SARS - cov-2 figure 4 ( below ) in which the red arrow indicates the site of emergence of SARS - cov-2 . \nit emerged from the same species as the original SARS , hence its name . \nas noted above , this particular species is known to taxonomists as the \u201c SARS - related coronaviruses \u201d after its then most famous member ( coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , 2020 ) . \nas discussed , from a zoonotic perspective , nothing appears to be special about these SARS - related coronaviruses . \nconsequently , the the same coronavirus species constitutes a second surprising coincidence . \nwe can again calculate its probability . \nif each alpha and betacoronavirus species is equally likely to spill over to humans , which is consistent with our understanding , then the probability of a virus from the SARS - related coronavirus species starting a zoonotic pandemic is 1 in 28 . ( \nand if there are undiscovered coronavirus species\u2013\u2013pretty much a certainty\u2013\u2013the number will be greater still ) . \nit is a coincidence that , just like the emergence in wuhan , heavily favours a the specifics of the coronavirus research programme at the WIV , which are outlined below . \nconsider the following list of publication titles , many accepted in prestigious journals , from between 2005 and the start of the pandemic in late 2019 . \nthey are all authored by zheng - li shi . \nthese eighteen research papers constitute the main focus of her published output . \nwhat they have in common is that all use the phrase \u201c SARS - like coronavirus \u201d or , later , \u201c SARS - related coronavirus \u201d or a close variant ( all should be understood as technical terms . \nthey denote viruses extremely closely related to SARS and only distantly related to other coronaviruses : \u2022 \u2018 full - length genome sequences of two SARS - like coronaviruses in horseshoe bats and genetic variation analysis \u2019 ( 2006 ) ; \u2022 \u2018 evidence of the recombinant origin of a bat severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) -like coronavirus and its implications on the direct ancestor of SARS coronavirus \u2019 ( 2008 ) ; \u2022 \u2018 difference in receptor usage between severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) coronavirus ( 2008 ) ; \u2022 \u2018 virus - like particles of SARS - like coronavirus formed by membrane proteins from different origins demonstrate stimulating activity in human dendritic cells \u2019 ( 2008 ) ; \u2022 \u2018 immunogenicity difference between the SARS coronavirus and the bat SARS - like coronavirus spike ( S ) proteins \u2019 ( 2009 ) ; \u2022 \u2018 intraspecies diversity of SARS - like coronaviruses in rhinolophus sinicus and its implications for the origin of SARS coronaviruses in humans \u2019 ( 2010 ) ; \u2022 \u2018 immunogenicity of the spike glycoprotein of bat SARS - like coronavirus \u2018 ( 2010 determinants of the spike protein of SARS - like coronavirus \u2018 ( 2013 ) ; \u2022 isolation and characterization of a bat SARS - like coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor ( 2013 ) ; \u2022 \u2018 bat severe acute respiratory syndrome - like coronavirus WIV1 encodes an extra accessory protein , ORFX , involved in modulation of the host immune response \u2019 ( 2016 ) ; \u2022 longitudinal surveillance of SARS - like coronaviruses in bats by quantitative real - time PCR \u2019 ( 2016 ) ; \u2022 \u2018 discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS - related coronaviruses provides new insights ( 2017 ) ; what this list demonstrates is that , while zheng - li shi at the WIV focused on virus collection , above all , she dedicated her research to understanding zoonotic spillovers to humans of one species alone : the SARS - related coronaviruses . \nso while most discussions of a potential lab escape have mentioned that SARS - cov-2 emerged within commuting distance of the WIV and that researchers at the WIV worked on bat coronaviruses , none have mentioned that the coincidence is much greater than that . \nzheng - li shi concentrated , especially with on the particular species of coronavirus that is responsible for the pandemic . \nthere is a simple reason for this focus . \nthe original SARS outbreak in 2002 - 04 had a major impact in china . \nfinding the origin , explaining SARS and its symptoms , and preventing a repeat all became major research priorities for chinese scientists . \nto be sure , zheng - li shi published papers on other coronavirus species over that same time - period , for example on MERS , and even some on non - coronaviruses ; but these articles tended to be one - offs large majority of her output and the dominant theme of her research was collecting and manipulating SARS - related coronaviruses to determine the potential for human spillover . \nso , if one accepts as reasonable the assumptions made above , the probability of wuhan being the site of a natural SARS - related coronavirus outbreak is obtained by multiplying 1 in 630 by 1 in 28 . \nthe chance of wuhan hosting a SARS - related coronavirus outbreak is thus 17,640\u20131 . \nthe criticism will doubtless be made that the geographic and the phylogenetic evidence described here are circumstantial \u2013 mere is based on a common logical misconception \u2013 that circumstantial evidence represents a special category of evidence . \nas the philosopher david hume first argued , all evidence of causation is composed of coincidences . \nall an observer can do is to add up the coincidences until they surmise that the threshold of reasonable doubt has been surpassed . \nconclusions are always provisional , but in the absence of evidence to the contrary , anyone open to persuasion ought at this point to conclude that a probability of 17,640\u20131 far exceeds that threshold . \nA the default hypothesis . \nsuch a conclusion is only reinforced by much of the important information that has emerged since the outbreak began . \nwe now know , for example , that , at the time of the outbreak , zheng - li shi and her colleagues had in their freezers the virus sample known as ratg13 . \namong all the known coronaviruses , including within the SARS - related coronaviruses , ratg13 is by far the closest relative of SARS - cov-2 . \nwe also know that zheng - li shi implied she had not actively studied ratg13 prior to , 2020 ) . \nwe now know this was false and they had been studying it since at least 2017 ( zhou et al . \n2020 addendum ) . \nthese facts again do not support a natural zoonotic origin . \nif there were a credible zoonotic origin theory for the emergence of SARS - cov-2 then such a calculation might be considered moot . \nbut , despite considerable academic discussion ( e.g . \nleitner and kumar , 2020 ; seyran et al . \n2020 ; sallard et al . , \n2020 ) and a WHO investigation theory to speak of . \nsnakes , bamboo rats , pangolins , mink , turtles , dogs , civets , whales , and frozen cod , have all , at various times , been suggested as intermediate vectors that might have carried SARS - cov-2 , or coronavirus precursors of it , to wuhan ; but neither a theory , nor a proximal spillover virus , nor a plausible intermediate host has gained significant support in the scientific community . \nthe excellent reason is that data supporting them are largely lacking despite the apparently very 2020 ) . \nthe most concrete of these zoonotic theories , and by far the most widely known , is the pangolin ( manis javanica ) theory ( anderson et al . , \n2020 ; lam et al . , \n2020 ; xiao et al . , \n2020 ) . \nit is proposed that pangolins smuggled from countries to the south of china harboured precursor coronaviruses picked up from bats , thereby bringing them to wuhan . \nhowever , newly available evidence has made this scenario improbable . \nfirst , pangolins do not seem , after lee et al . , \n2020 ) . \nsecond , the pangolin theory rests largely on virus sequences obtained from pangolins confiscated in guangdong province in early 2019 . \nattempted independent verification of these virus sequences has uncovered that , although four publications ( now highly cited ) discuss or report pangolin coronavirus sequences and therefore appear to support the widespread presence of coronaviruses in pangolins , only one virus genome was ever sequenced ( chan and zhan , 2020 ) . \nthe papers by xiao et al . ( \n2020 ) and liu renamed and reconfigured sequence information generated by liu et al . \n2019 . \nthis is the same pangolin coronavirus data set discussed by lam et al . , \n2020 . \ncurrent thinking , in light of this new evidence , is that the smuggled pangolins were an \u2018 incidental host \u2019 of the coronavirus . \nthat is , the pangolins likely caught the virus while being smuggled ( chan and zhan , 2020 ; lee et al , 2020 ) . \nin stark contrast , there are four distinct lab origin theories and these . \ntwo are published in the scientific literature ( sirotkin and sirotkin , 2020 ; segreto and deigin , 2020 ) . \nA third proposes that SARS - cov-2 was a failed attempt to develop a vaccine . \nthis theory was developed by an independent group of online researchers called DRASTIC . \nthe fourth is our own mojiang miners passage theory . \nthis latter theory starts from the fact that viruses in the same mine where ratg13 ( the closest related viral sequence to SARS - cov-2 ) was sampled appear to have given rise to a outbreak , six miners were hospitalized with COVID-19 - like symptoms and three died ( rahalkar and bahulikar , 2020 ) . \nall had been shovelling bat guano and were diagnosed at the time as likely suffering from an unknown coronavirus . \nsamples from four of the hospitalized miners were sent to the WIV for testing . \nto - date , there are conflicting claims about the results of those tests and nothing has been formally published ( zhou et al . \n2020 addendum ) . \nthe mojiang miners passage theory proposes , however , that , WIV , these patient - derived samples contained a highly adapted human virus , which subsequently escaped . \nfor the present moment , notwithstanding the claim of the WHO investigation and the censorship of facebook , all of these accidental lab origin theories appear plausible to us , but all remain uninvestigated . \nour prediction , however , simply based on assessing the probabilities , is that no convincing natural zoonotic origin for the pandemic will ever be found by china or the WHO or anyone else\u2013\u2013for the simple reason that one does not exist , A. , lipkin , W.

\nbut perhaps none were more pronounced than this : I \u2019 m not donald trump . \nbiden \u2019 s predecessor spent four years disparaging world leaders \u2014 in public and on twitter \u2014 accusing their countries of freeloading off the united states . \nhe pulled out of international agreements , refused to sign others and scoffed at the trans - atlantic alliances that served as a bedrock of U.S. foreign policy in the post - WWII era . \nthree years ago in canada , of the world \u2019 s wealthiest and most powerful nations , a moment enshrined in a photo of him sitting with his arms crossed triumphantly as other leaders stood around him , either exasperated or appearing to implore him to act . \nso many leaders at the latest G-7 meeting , including those from germany , france and canada , seemed simply eager to move past trump this week ; so much so that they greeted biden like an old friend even when he wasn \u2019 t . \nas the world leaders walked summit began , french president emmanuel macron , who had never met biden before , put his arm around him and the two walked arm and arm . \nthey engaged in a brief but animated conversation that included talking about ways to make democracies more effective for the middle class , one of biden \u2019 s favorite topics . \u201c \nbeing able to meet joe biden is obviously important because he stands for the commitment to multilateralism , which we were missing in recent years . \u201d \nsaid german chancellor angela merkel , one just after she arrived at the summit friday . \neven british prime minister boris johnson , closer to trump than any other G-7 leader , declared that everyone is \u201c absolutely thrilled \u201d to see biden and called their meeting \u201c a breath of fresh air . \u201d \nlater when reporters asked if that comment was a criticism of trump , the prime minister 's spokesperson said it was simply a reflection of their shared interests of security and climate change . \nsome of the camaraderie in england could be chalked up to world of overt flattery . \nbut much of it , experts say , is the outcome of international relations finally returning to a state of norm after four years of intense whiplash . \nthe leaders may not have uttered trump \u2019 s name out loud but his presence was felt . \u201c \nthere 's no way of describing our friends ' relief at the change of administration . \nand not just because it is n't donald trump anymore , \u201d said stephen sestanovich , a former national security council and state department official . \nhas a backlog of real problems to address . \nthe biden administration wants to talk about how to develop cooperative responses to them in a way that the trump administration could n't ever be serious about . \u201d \nbiden arrived in england wednesday to attend several meetings \u2014 the G-7 , NATO and those with european union and european council leaders \u2014 and to discuss a host of issues , including covid , the economy and the challenges posed by russia and china . \nhis final stop will be in geneva , where he , a meeting for which biden has already received criticism . \nthis week , the G-7 countries are expected to organize no less than eight committees to work on policy issues , including the corporate tax rate ( an agreement was reached among the G-7 to implement a 15 percent minimum rate ) , technology , trade , travel and the pandemic . \nthose working groups generally didn \u2019 t happen when trump was president . \ninstead , trump , who never held office before being elected to president , played the role , undermining trade deals and questioning U.S. military commitments and bases overseas . \nhe backed brexit in part to delegitimize the european union , constantly criticized countries for not spending enough on defense and lodged tariffs on european exports . \nbiden , who spent decades both as member on the senate foreign relations committee and vice president , is perceived internationally as someone U.S. allies can work with on issues ranging from climate change to holding iran accountable for its nuclear ambitions . \nafter biden was elected , foreign leaders and diplomats quickly back something that had been missing for four years : normalcy . \u201c \namerica is back . \nand we are happy you are back , \u201d european council president charles michel told biden in march during a video summit . \nstill , some leaders are skeptical that U.S. politics , with its deep partisan divisions , will remain stable enough for the country to return to its place as a reliable global power . \nle monde , a leading french newspaper , said in an editorial after the election that \u201c trumpism \u201d lasting heritage of american politics . \u201d \u201c \nthe allies do have lingering doubts about the forces that produced trump 's election in 2016 and are wondering whether those forces are gone for good , or that possibility that the US could shift back to a more contentious , more transactional approach to NATO in 2022 , or 20 2024 , \u201d said alexander vershbow , former deputy secretary of NATO and former ambassador to south korea and russia . \u201c \nI think this concern is real that , you know , the trumpian full bore . \nand in the midterms , or in the next presidential election . \u201d \nbut vershbow , now a fellow at the atlantic council , said european allies are adopting unique approaches to the U.S now that biden is in office . \ngermany , for example , wants the U.S. to resume its place as a leader while france doesn \u2019 t think the U.S. can be trusted as much as it used to be . \nbut macron , who has tried to fill the leadership vacuum left by trump , appeared much so that their interactions sparked a flurry of social media attention and led the british media to dub it a budding bromance . \nthe two will meet formally saturday . \nbiden has tried to nurture that idea that he is trump \u2019 s inverse on the global stage . \nsince he was sworn into office , he has rejoined the paris climate accord , backed an attempt to revive the iran nuclear deal and has spoken repeatedly about the importance of alliances , international diplomacy and emphasized america \u2019 s commitment to leaders that the U.S. backs NATO \u2019 s doctrine of collective defense and would aid a member state in the face of russian aggression . \nbut there are still some worries about america \u2019 s policies under biden . \ncountries fret about the U.S. decision to pull troops out of afghanistan by sept. 11 ; the lack of urgency over the nord stream 2 pipeline being built to bring gas from russia to germany under the baltic sea ; and the ways the U.S. is approaching its economic rival china . \njohnson , on thursday , supports biden \u2019 s commitment to fighting climate change and the sharing of the covid vaccine with poorer countries , which health officials say should have been done sooner . \nbut he is still waiting for biden to help push through a U.K.-U.S. trade deal . \nheather conley , who served as a deputy assistant secretary of state during the george W. bush administration , said U.S. allies thought the biden administration would be following their agenda , but instead it appears that biden wants them to follow his . \ns a marked shift from the trump era in policy and tone . \nthe leaders still may have their differences but they \u2019 ll air them behind closed doors or through diplomatic channels . \u201c \nthere is no longer a feeling of complete dread before a NATO or G-7 summit or fearing that the meetings would upend U.S. policy , \u201d said conley , now a senior vice president at the center for strategic and international studies . \u201c \nthere was much more energy devoted to managing or mitigating former president trump before the actual summit agenda . \nthis doesn \u2019 t mean U.S. allies agree with the biden administration on their initiatives , but these meetings will be predictable , stable and possibly productive . \u201d \nryan heath , rym momtaz and esther webber contributed to this report . \n"}, {"id": 81, "body":

lawsuits by civil rights organizations , that the company finally removed the ability of advertisers to exclude legally protected groups from seeing housing , employment and credit ads . \nyet the

federal government required hospitals to begin sharing their previously confidential pricing data by earlier this year , journalists and researchers have been able to document substantial differences between what different patients pay for the same procedure , offering critical insights to policymakers . \nimagine if all e - commerce sites with more than a certain number of users were forced to publish hourly snapshots of the maximum and minimum prices they charged for each item on their site , allowing similar external scrutiny . \nsuch to prevent competitive misuse while still offering critical transparency into just how much of an impact differential pricing is having on american consumers . \nsimilarly , what if \u201c free \u201d ad - supported platforms with more than a certain number of users had to offer each of their users a monthly report detailing every purchase , sale or collection of their personal data and how much money , including ad revenue , they made from that user and all of the companies and governments that purchased access to their data ? \nthis would allow of our data that we essentially barter for access to these platforms is steadily increasing and would provide evidence as to whether the hidden price we pay for social platforms is steadily increasing . \nas foreshadowed by tiktok , future top social media and e - commerce platforms may not be american companies or even have a physical or financial presence in the U.S. , complicating antitrust enforcement . \nmaking these transparency requirements an amendment to section 230 would ensure

days before a civil trial in the case that was set to start . \nit would have focused on a novel legal issue about whether hastert \u2019 s to buy the silence of a man he abused as a teenager amounted to a legally binding contract . \nthe man has been referred to only as james doe in court papers since the breach of contract lawsuit was filed in 2016 in illinois court in yorkville , hastert 's hometown just west of chicago . \nthe hush - money deal would eventually lead to a federal criminal case against hastert five years later and to public disgrace for the a GOP stalwart who , for eight years as house speaker , was second in . \nin the federal case , prosecutors said hastert sexually abused at least four male students between the ages of 14 and 17 throughout his years at yorkville high school . \nhastert was in his 20s and 30s . \nfederal prosecutors said during criminal proceedings that the hush - money deal was voluntarily entered into and that the victim never sought to blackmail hastert that he \u2019 d go public about the abuse . \nthe abuse happened when the victim was a high school wrestler and the now 79 - year - old hastert was his coach . \nhastert but stopped the payments after the FBI questioned him in 2014 about illegally concealing huge cash withdraws from his bank . \nafter hastert pleaded guilty to a banking charge and was sentenced to over a year in

would likely have been emotionally draining for both hastert and the man he abused , both of whom could have been called to testify . \nquestions were raised during the over four years since the suit was filed about whether hastert \u2019 s legal team might try to suggest doe was trying to extort the ex - speaker . \nbrowne said judge pilmer ruled earlier that hastert 's lawyers could not attempt

\nthe outbreak in the mojiang mine by the time of these revelations , yet other questions had arisen about ratg13 . \nit turned out that ratg13 was an exact genetic match to an already published partial virus sequence called btcov/4991 . \nbtcov/4991 had been obtained by zheng - li shi \u2019 s group in 2013 from a mine in yunnan province , china ( ge et al . , \n2016 ) . \nfurthermore , ratg13 and btcov/4991 were from the same bat anal swab sample . \nin other words , from the . \nthus , ratg13 did have a publishing history , but under the name btcov/4991 ( bengston , 2020 ) . \nin addition to btcov/4991 another novel betacoronavirus was found at the same time . \ntheir discoverers concluded the following : \u201c considering that the two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses SARS - cov and MERS - cov ) in this genus [ the betacoronaviruses ] originated from bats ( ge et al . , \n2013 ; lau et al . , \n2013 ; corman et al . , \n2014 ) , attention should be particularly paid to these lineages of , 2016 ) according to their own words , it would therefore be surprising had zheng - li shi \u2019 s group not gone on to study btcov/4991 aka ratg13 . \nyet the discovery of this publication trail only deepened the mystery yet further . \nthough never mentioned by ge et al . , \nthe \u2018 abandoned \u2019 mine ( which subsequently became known as the mojiang mine ) where btcov/4991 was found had recently been the site of a mystery disease outbreak . \nin april 2012 , just two and a half months before the had become sick and three of them had died . \nindeed , the mine outbreak was presumably why the WIV researchers were sampling there ( and the zhou et al . \naddendum later confirmed this ) . \nthe nature of the 2012 disease outbreak became much clearer with the discovery ( by an anonymous twitter user called theseeker268 ) of a 2013 chinese master \u2019 s thesis . \nthis thesis is titled \u201c the analysis of six patients with severe pneumonia caused by unknown viruses \u201c . \nits abstract specifically mentions a learn more about the 2012 pneumonia outbreak , we arranged to have the master \u2019 s thesis translated into english . \nthe translation yielded a cornucopia of information . \nthis began with the fact that the author of the thesis was the doctor who supervised the testing and treatment of the miners at the first affiliated hospital of kunming medical university ( yunnan province ) . \naccording to the master \u2019 s thesis , the miners had been shovelling bat guano . \nthis implied that the mystery disease probably originated from bats . \nand consultations led the author to conclude that the most likely cause of the outbreak was a coronavirus . \nbut perhaps most startling of all the findings to emerge from the translation was that the symptoms of the miners closely resembled those of COVID-19 ( rahalkar and bahulikar , 2020b ) . \nthe master \u2019 s thesis thus raised a host of questions . \nwhy did the ge et al . \n2016 publication ( from zheng - li shi \u2019 s lab ) , which sampled the mine on multiple occasions , make no mention be sampling there in the first place ? \nwhy did zheng - li shi tell scientific american in march 2020 that the miners died of a fungal infection ? \nwhy did her zhou et al . \n2020 publication rename btcov/4991 as ratg13 without explanation or even referencing the earlier work on btcov/4991 or its mine origin ? \nespecially , given that zheng - li shi and her corona - colleagues in china and elsewhere have constantly warned of coronavirus spillovers from bats ( e.g . \nzhou et al . , \n2018 ) , why did no one seemingly prove or \u2019 s thesis ? \nare we to presume that an apparent textbook case of a zoonotic spillover , significant enough at the time to be covered by science magazine , was in the end simply ignored ? \nso many interrelated errors and omissions present a conundrum . \nare these concatenated oversights simply innocent happenstances ? \nor were they deliberate attempts to obscure the connections from ratg13 back to btcov/4991 and from there to the mine and thence to the mine outbreak ; to thereby prevent anyone in 2020 linking SARS - cov-2 and the mine about the mine or the miners of deep significance to the current pandemic ? \nif so , what ? \nthe value of the phd thesis given that the broader context of the pandemic origin is the failure of a plausible zoonotic origin scenario to emerge ( quay , 2021 ; segreto et al . , \n2021 ) , we have attempted to resolve this conundrum by proposing the mojiang miners passage theory of the origin of SARS - cov-2 . \nthe theory was stimulated chiefly by two observations . \nthe first was that some of the for about five months ( april to september , 2012 ) . \nthe second key observation was the assertion in the master \u2019 s thesis that diagnostic samples taken from four of the miners were sent to the wuhan institute of virology . \nwhat we proposed , in short , is that the miners contracted one , or maybe multiple , ratg13 - like bat coronaviruses in the mine . \nthe long hospitalization of the miners enabled the initial bat virus to evolve into a human coronavirus by providing conditions similar to extended viral passaging WIV therefore contained a humanised virus and we proposed it was similar , or even identical , to SARS - cov-2 . \nvirus isolation , or virus culture in human or other cells , or perhaps even gain - of - function type experiments , then permitted this virus to later escape from the WIV in late 2019 . \ngiven all this , a very significant unresolved question becomes : what tests were done on the samples taken from the miners and sent to the WIV ? \nwhat were the results ? \nthe answers are important not only for for other explanations of the pandemic origin . \nfor example , other lab escape theories have proposed that ratg13 ( or a similar unpublished genome ) was the likely backbone for gain - of - function research ( see sirotkin and sirotkin , 2020 ; segreto and deigin , 2020 ; segreto et al . , \n2021 ; kaina , 2021 ) . \nbut it is also possible that a virus extracted from the miners was the starting point . \naccording to the master \u2019 s thesis , prof. nanshan zhong advised SARS testing and samples from four . \nthese tested positive for coronavirus in an igm antibody test ( see fig . \n1 ) . \nin their november addendum zheng - li shi and her colleagues at the WIV confirmed receiving thirteen serum samples \u2013 taken at approximately monthly intervals in 2012 \u2013 from four of the hospitalised miners . \nbut here there is a major discrepancy . \nreferring to the miner serum samples , the addendum states : \u201c we tested the samples using PCR methods developed in our laboratory targeting the RNA - dependent RNA polymerases of ebola virus , nipah virus and bat sarsr - covrp3 , these viruses . \nwe also tested the serum samples for the presence of antibodies against the nucleocapsid proteins of these three viruses , and none of the samples gave a positive result . \nrecently , we retested the samples with our validated enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) against the SARS coronavirus 2 ( SARS - cov-2 ) nucleocapsid protein \u2013 which has greater than 90 % amino acid sequence identity with sarsr - covrp3 \u2013 and confirmed that these patients were not infected by SARS - cov-2 . \u201d ( \nzhou et al . , \n2020 , addendum ) the implication is that , WIV , SARS - cov-2 was not found and no evidence for any other coronavirus was found either . \nthis obviously contradicts the master \u2019 s thesis . \nthe difference between these two positions is crucial . \nif a coronavirus of any kind was found in the miners \u2019 samples it would likely alter our whole understanding of the pandemic origin . \nthis is because every possible effort would surely have been made to identify it , grow it in cultured human cells , sequence its genome , characterise its infectivity , and much more this . \nfirst , discovering a coronavirus infection in the miners would triumphantly vindicate the basic research premise of zheng - li shi and the WIV . \ntheir pitch is that bat coronaviruses are dangerous pathogens that may at any moment jump to humans and other animals . \nsecond , a novel coronavirus in the miners would represent a veritable research bonanza : a highly lethal zoonotic disease outbreak caught in the act . \nby the same token , if a coronavirus was found in the miners \u2019 samples in 2012/2013 it would surely also WIV , that might have led to the pandemic , was being concealed . \nthis then is the background to our interest in any credible document containing further evidence that the trail from the miners did not go cold after the 2012 outbreak . \nfor many months , a scientific document has been shared on the internet that appears to shed much light on the fate of samples taken from the mine and the miners and their broader context . \nit is a translation of a chinese phd thesis originally written in 2016 it also was found on the chinese thesis database by theseeker268 . \nits english title is \u201c novel virus discovery in bat and the exploration of receptor of bat coronavirus HKU9 \u201d . ( \ndownload the phd thesis here ) the author of this thesis is canping huang , who was a student of gao fu . \ngao fu is an important virologist known in the west as george gao . \nin 2017 he was appointed head of china \u2019 s center for disease control and prevention , china \u2019 s CDC huang thesis , however , is that the author is one of relatively few researchers documented to have sampled the mojiang mine for bat viruses . \npreviously , a provisional and partial translation of this thesis was generated , using google translate , by the previously mentioned francisco A. de ribera . \nusing this earlier version as a guide , we have organised a professional and expanded translation . \nthis new version focuses on the parts of the thesis most relevant to the origin story of SARS - cov-2 ; in particular , chapter 3 of unexplained severe pneumonia incidents related to an abandoned mining cave found in mojiang hani autonomous county , yunnan province . \nthe canping huang thesis substantiates several aspects of the mojiang miners passage theory . \nbut perhaps the most significant of all its statements is that samples from four of the miners were tested at the WIV for igg antibodies against the SARS virus . \naccording to the phd ( see fig . \n3 ) , all samples were positive . ( \nthis test is distinct from the igm test mentioned in the logical interpretation of an igg antibody test for SARS giving a positive result in 2012 is that the miners were infected with a coronavirus , presumably a SARS - related one . \nit is highly unlikely , however , that the miners had SARS itself , since the SARS virus had not been observed since 2003 . \nmoreover , the original SARS outbreak was in guangdong province , far from the mojiang mine . \nthus , the miners presumably were infected with a virus similar , but not identical to , SARS , i.e . \nthis is the conclusion reached also by the master \u2019 s thesis ( see fig 4 ) . \nwhat adds particular credibility to the phds \u2019 claim are its specifics . \naccording to canping huang , of the four miners : \u201c two discharged patients had higher antibody levels , whereas two hospitalized patients had lower antibody levels \u201d . \nsuch details imply that the phd \u2019 s assertion of positive SARS tests is not a simple mistake , nor based on mere hearsay . \nrather , as the mysterious pneumonia outbreak was mine ( see chapter 3 . ) , \nthese results had crucial significance to the thesis ; just as they would have had to his supervisor and the chinese CDC . \nfurthermore , a phd is a peer - reviewed document . \nit has to be accepted by the supervisor and a committee . \nif the tests and/or the positive results were cited in error then these were multiple errors with multiple parents . \nindeed , in an interview with french TV ( at 18:23 ) , george gao was asked about the antibody tests positive tests . \nsince it is not easy to dismiss , this assertion of multiple positive tests is a fact of great significance . \nas we and others have suggested , it seems likely that the miners had COVID - like symptoms because they were infected with a SARS - like coronavirus . \nif so , researchers at the WIV have attempted to hide that diagnosis . \nis it time for an addendum to the addendum ? \nideally , one would seek to clarify precisely where the assertions in the phd thesis ( positive igg test of master \u2019 s thesis ( positive igm tests for an unspecified number of patients ) contradict those in the zhou et al . \naddendum . \nhowever , although it purports to resolve the issues , the addendum is a complete mismatch with the questions raised by either thesis . \nfirstly , nowhere does the addendum positively state that no virus or no coronavirus was found in the miner \u2019 s serum samples . \nsecondly , the addendum does not mention a SARS test . \nit mentions instead two different tests for sarsr - cov - rp3 ( , and one test for SARS - cov-2 . \nit is presumably possible that both the phd and the master \u2019 s were mistaken and conflated tests for sarsr - covrp3 with ones for SARS itself ( or perhaps were misinformed ) ; but this does not alter the situation fundamentally since , contra the addendum , both theses claim the results were positive . \nfailure to directly address the principal questions spotlights a noteworthy additional defect of the addendum . \nit lacks the key accoutrements of a scientific publication . \nthe addendum asserts the results of fully described , nor are the materials and reagents . \nthe results , including controls , are also not shown . \nimportantly too , the eight similar viruses mentioned as being found along with ratg13/4991 are neither referenced nor specified by name , even though their genomes may be crucial for tracing the pandemic \u2019 s origins . \nit is unscientific and ultimately somewhat ridiculous to take the trouble to publish an addendum making strong , and controversial , claims that are crucial to understanding the origin of a global pandemic costing millions scrutiny of those claims impossible . \nnevertheless , the addendum holds yet more surprises . \nwhen canping huang identified and isolated novel viruses from his bat samples , the methods he used , in chap 3 . , \nwere pan - coronavirus primers in PCR experiments and viral metagenomics in the form of next generation sequencing ( NGS ) . \nyet neither method is mentioned in the addendum . \nthe tests described by the addendum are not worthless , but they are also not best practice when the question is how to detect a mystery coronavirus world - leading institute , did not apply the most sensitive or effective available methods in this crucial and unprecedented instance of a zoonotic jump caught in flagrante . \nchina is a leader in gene sequencing technology but one could perhaps imagine that in 2012 - 13 NGS was unavailable to zheng - li shi . \nhowever , we know that she sent samples to beijing for NGS as early as 2011 ( ge et al . , \n2012 ) . \nin any case , it is available today . \nwhen zheng - li shi \u2019 s group deciphered the genome of in wuhan they used pan - coronavirus primers and metagenomic sequencing to obtain the full length genome ( zhou et al . , \n2020 ) . \nwe know too that the miner \u2019 s samples are apparently not depleted since the addendum claims to have \u2018 retested \u2019 them \u2018 recently \u2019 . \nadditionally , there are now powerful methods for retrieving degraded and low abundance genetic material , even from biological samples millions of years old ( e.g . \ndabney et al . , \n2013 ) . \nin 1997 the spanish flu influenza genome was reconstructed al . , \n1997 ) . \nif necessary , such methods could surely be applied to any of the extant samples from the miners . \nthe phd thesis translation prompts still further questions about the addendum and the miners \u2019 samples , for example , we need to know more about the 13 serum samples . \nwhat dates were they taken on and which miners did each come from ? \nalso , the master \u2019 s thesis mentions extraction of the thymus of patient 4 , while both it and the phd mention that p. 82 ) . \naccording to both theses , such samples were sometimes sent to other institutions . \nin many cases , these samples probably represent better opportunities to collect a coronavirus and demonstrate a virus spillover than does a serum sample . \ndid the WIV receive or request other samples ? \nwere tests performed on them ? \nif so , were they also negative ? \nthese questions , one hopes , will perhaps be answered in an addendum 2 . \nin the final analysis this situation is ultimately quite simple : two and canping huang \u2019 s phd ) clearly and credibly contradict the implication of the addendum on the key question of whether a coronavirus was detected in the miners \u2019 serum samples . \nmoreover , these two sources predate the pandemic . \nunlike the WIV authors , no case can reasonably be made that the two thesis authors were motivated by self - preservation as a consequence of the pandemic . \nthe WIV authors , in contrast , have a track record of misleading statements and clear omissions in connection with the miners outbreak and original addendum . \nfurther revelations of the canping huang phd thesis the canping huang phd contains other data and important statements . \nit corroborates the master \u2019 s thesis , lends significant support to the mojiang miners passage theory , and further contradicts the accounts of researchers from the WIV . \n1 ) canping huang was a virologist . \ntogether with a team assembled by the chinese CDC , he searched the mojiang mine specifically for viruses . \nin all , at least four independent teams of chinese virologists ( some representing multiple beginning in july 2012 , researchers from zheng - li shi \u2019 s lab at the WIV visited the mine up to seven times ( WHO report , annex , p131 ) . \nin it they found several hundred alphacoronaviruses and ten betacoronaviruses [ the addendum states nine betacoronaviruses but it appears to omit hpbtcov/3740 - 2 , which was also found there ( ge et al . , \n2016 ) ] ( zhou et al . , \n2020 addendum ) . \nof these , the betacoronaviruses are the most significant because ratg13 and SARS - cov-2 are betacoronaviruses . \nlater medical college and the institute of pathogen biology in beijing also took samples . \nthey identified a paramyxovirus in rats from the mine ( wu et al . , \n2014 ) . \nthe third team was a group from the university of hong kong who found alphacoronaviruses in the mine ( lau et a. , 2015 ) . \nthe fourth was canping huang in 2014 . \nthis intense sampling activity shows that prominent chinese researchers like george gao suspected that the causative agent of the mine outbreak was a virus , and were still , the march 2021 WHO report , like the earlier scientific american interview , attributes the miners \u2019 illnesses to a fungal infection ( WHO annex , p131 ) . \nhowever , it should be emphasized that , once again , this mention of a fungal origin by the WHO is not supported by any data or cited evidence . \nnor is there any suggestion that fungal biologists investigated the outbreak . \nthe case for a fungal outbreak is therefore very weak . \n2 ) canping huang and his colleagues caught and killed sampling bias suggests bats were still considered the most likely source of the miners \u2019 disease in 2014 . \n3 ) in these bats , canping huang found four astroviruses , one bocavirus and two alphacoronaviruses . \nthis indicates that bats with coronaviruses continued to be present in the mine in 2014 , two years after the outbreak . \nmore importantly , his use of degenerate ( i.e . \nall - purpose ) PCR primers designed to amplify coronavirus genomes ( see chapter 3 of the phd ) demonstrates that canping huang was actively searching certain other viruses too ) . \n4 ) the phd also states that blood samples from the miners were sent to the wuhan institute of virology . \nprior to the november zhou addendum , only the master \u2019 s thesis made such a claim . \nthanks to canping huang \u2019 s thesis , three independent sources agree that serum / blood samples were sent to the wuhan institute of virology . \n5 ) the thesis also confirms important statements in the master \u2019 s thesis that samples from the infected miners were sent to laboratories : \u201c in order to analyze the pathology and the cause of the disease , the chinese yunnan centers for disease control and prevention , other medical centers and other research labs collected samples from the patients , bats , rats and the environment . \nthe blood samples of four cases showed that : four patients \u2019 throat swabs and whole blood samples were negative for SARS coronavirus * , epidemic hemorrhagic fever , dengue fever ( type 1 - 4 ) , epidemic encephalitis type B , flavivirus and alphavirus pathogen nucleic acid tests ( ) . \nthe blood samples of four of the cases , and from four other people who had been to the cave yet had no symptoms , all showed no abnormal results ( guangdong , lab of nan shan zhong ) ; the bats in the mine were dissected , and bat feces were tested , and no abnormality was found ( wuhan institute of virology , chinese academy of sciences ) \u2026 \u2026 half a year later , the jin qi lab went to the same cave to collect samples from bats and wild note : A negative test for SARS , performed soon after admission of the miners to hospital , is also mentioned in the master \u2019 s thesis , which largely discounts its results . \nthis quite lengthy list of interested laboratories , goes beyond those listed in the master \u2019 s thesis , but is not surprising . \nA lethal disease outbreak originating from bats with a probable viral aetiology is not an everyday occurrence . \nthe previous one in china was declared a pandemic : the first SARS outbreak in 2002 . \ncoronaviruses all over china hoping to assess zoonotic spillover risks ( e.g . \nlau et al . , \n2015 ) . \ntheir special emphasis has been on progenitors of the first SARS and viruses from bats . \nthus , it would have represented a major aberration for the miners \u2019 pneumonia to not be investigated thoroughly . \nenvironmental samples and patients samples from the mojiang mine would likely have been seen as extremely valuable , in part to protect public health but also as opportunities for prestigious research . \nthese are the reasons why as those of george gao , zhong nanshan , zheng - li shi and qi jin became involved in investigating the outbreak . \nwe are nevertheless left with a mystery , which the canping huang thesis deepens considerably . \nwhy were only two quite minor scientific papers ever published that mentioned the mine , of which only one mentioned the outbreak ( wu et al . , \n2014 ; ge et al . , \n2016 ) ? \nit is hardly the case that an alternative cause for the outbreak was found . \never since the first SARS searched for potential human zoonotic pathogens , especially coronaviruses . \nA \u201c major project \u201d called \u201c discovery of zoonotic pathogens and study of its pathogenicity to humans \u201d was funded by the national science foundation of china for this specific purpose . \nthis programme was established in 2012 , the year of the mine outbreak , and included zheng - li shi as one of its principle investigators . \nthere are strong signs that plenty of this emerging infectious coronavirus research remains unpublished , even those parts that are highly connected to the origins chapter 3 . \nof canping huang \u2019 s thesis was never published or otherwise made available . \nthough he identified two alphacoronaviruses in the mojiang mine and obtained partial genome sequences , he did not show them . \nthey are not in the thesis itself nor does he seem to have deposited them in any public database . \nA key example is that zheng - li shi also possesses unpublished coronavirus genomes from the mine . \nthese include at least eight other very closely related betacoronaviruses that she has featured in several recent oral presentations and genome sequences . \nthese are called ra7909 , rst7896 , rst7905 , rst7907 , rst7921 , rst7924 , rst7931 , and rst7952 . \nthese genomes , if published , would approximately double the number of published genomes in the SARS - cov-2 phylogenetic clade , which is the phylogenetic group containing all the closest relatives of SARS - cov-2 . \nthe information contained in these genomes would doubtless be extremely valuable for understanding the ancestry of SARS - cov-2 . \nit is therefore remarkable that they remain unpublished over a year after the wuhan outbreak . \nsimilar points can betacoronavirus hpbtcov/3740 - 2 also identified from the mojiang mine by her group ( ge et al . , \nin 2016 ) . \nthe only publicly available information on this virus is a short fragment deposited in a database five years ago . \nadding to this list of unpublished research is a very interesting recent preprint by a group of independent researchers . \nit is titled \u201c unexpected novel merbecovirus discoveries in agricultural sequencing datasets from wuhan , china \u201d and it reports the existence of a series of hitherto unpublished full- and partial - length betacoronavirus genome ) . \nthese genomes were uncovered by examining chinese sequencing datasets ( mostly originating in wuhan ) uploaded to the NCBI genome repository . \nthese datasets were then searched by the authors for coronavirus sequence contamination . \ncoronavirus sequence reads found in these datasets were then assembled by the researchers into whole or partial coronavirus genomes . \nwhat such searches reveal are either instances of biological contamination ( e.g . \nstray viruses in biological cultures or whole organisms ) or stray sequences resulting from methodological contamination during sequencing \u2013 usually sample mix - ups of a kind findings made by these researchers were a full - length novel HKU5 - related coronavirus and an apparent full - length infectious clone of a novel HKU4 - related coronavirus . \nthese are both MERS - related coronaviruses . \nthese were not the only coronaviruses they found and therefore what the data suggests is that , in china , numerous labs are isolating , culturing , or otherwise studying unpublished coronaviruses . \nthese examples of unpublished viruses may only be the tip of an iceberg . \nwhat they and the examples that preceded it highlight , however , is the importance of accessing were taken offline at the outset of the pandemic . \nthese are where unpublished viral sequences from the WIV and elsewhere were stored . \nthe need to know which viruses closely related to SARS - cov-2 were being studied by scientists in wuhan in 2019 is urgent . \nfuture directions for lab origin investigations given the pattern of evidence that is accumulating it is encouraging that members of the US congress have written to peter daszak of the ecohealth alliance with a list of key questions about the relationship of the ecohealth alliance with the access to virus samples held by them and especially those samples related to the mojiang mine at the time of the outbreak ( see fig . \n5 ) . \nthe ecohealth alliance has had funding and active working relationships with coronavirus researchers at the WIV for over a decade . \ngiven the obstructive role it played in resisting investigations of laboratory origins , any effort to get answers from the ecohealth alliance deserves wide support . \nthe congressional letter is constructive in that it combines a precise focus on the key scientific data . \nin the final analysis , exactly who might have spilled the SARS - cov-2 virus is not necessarily more important to know than who funded them and who conceived and instigated the research . \nthe congressional letter raises many questions pertinent any investigation of the virus \u2019 origin . \nwhat is altered by the revelations of the phd is to render much more compelling the probability , first asserted in the master \u2019 s thesis , that there was a coronavirus in medical samples taken from the miners . \nthis in turn serves to zhou et al . \n2020 and especially its addendum . \nthese flaws make the likelihood that the mojiang mine played a key role in the COVID-19 outbreak seem ever more plausible and the need to obtain samples and sequences still more urgent . \nall origin possibilities should be considered and fully investigated . \nbut in our view , the mojiang miners passage origin theory is particularly valuable because it is a scientifically testable hypothesis . \nif a transparent and independent analysis of samples from each of the miners was carried out it should coronavirus infection . \nif present then its genome sequence ( even a quite short fragment ) would likely definitively prove , or disprove , it beyond any reasonable doubt . \naccording to the WHO origin report , chinese virologists have scoured the country for bat - derived coronaviruses . \nbut at the same time , the WIV and the ecohealth alliance have not shared what is apparently in their own freezers and databases . \nthe obstacle therefore seems not to be one of ability but of willingness . \nbut such obvious reticence carries a risk WIV and the ecohealth alliance show and the more they appear to dodge the key questions , the more the suspicion will unavoidably grow of their collective culpability for whatever really happened in wuhan in late 2019 . \nthe authors would like to acknowledge the generous assistance of francisco A de ribeira in preparing this article . \nandersen , K.

called heartbeat bill to have become law and actually be enforced . \nthe supreme court did \u2019 s enforcement as some had hoped : that evening , the top court allowed the law to stand in a 5 - 4 decision , with the five right - wing lawmakers firmly in camp against roe simply claiming it was a procedural issue that abortion providers had not addressed , voting in effect for texan women to lose the right to abortion provided under roe . \nfor janet porter , the texas law was a dream come true . \nthe longtime religious - right activist took to rumble , a posterboard of her book , \u201c A the background as she announced the news . \u201c \nthat makes texas the first state in the nation to actually enforce their heartbeat law of the 14 states who have passed them , \u201d she told the camera . \u201c \ngrasp this for a moment , \u201d she said , ecstatic , a smile spread across her face , her hands gesturing in excitement . \u201c \nthere is a place in the united states where nearly every child facing abortion is now legally protected . \nit is historic . \u201d \u201c \ntoday in texas the baby is protected , \u201d she said . \u201c \nsoon , the nation will follow . \u201d \nporter is often seen as the mastermind behind so - called heartbeat legislation , which bans women from having abortions after a \u201c heartbeat \u201d is detected \u2014 as early as six weeks in some cases and , for many women , before they \u2019 re aware that they are pregnant . \nmedical experts say the term \u201c fetal heartbeat \u201d is scientifically inaccurate , noting that at six weeks , the embryo \u2014 which is not yet a fetus \u2014 will have not term \u201c fetal heartbeat \u201d pulls at heartstrings , and its marketability , for a lack of better term , has porter to thank . \nwhile porter has made restricting access abortion her main priority , the longtime religious - right activist \u2019 s extremism has been well documented on these pages . \nas barack obama ran for president in 2008 , porter took to her radio program to spread the racist birther conspiracy theory championed by donald trump . \nonce obama was elected , the conspiracies didn \u2019 t stop : as right wing obama would orchestrate food shortages to starve conservatives to death , use a swine flu outbreak as an excuse to lock them up in concentration camps , and use obamacare to deny them healthcare and eliminate them . \u201d \non the pages of world net daily , a far - right conspiracy website , she frequently penned columns \u2014 her last , published dec. 11 , 2020 , refused to accept trump \u2019 s loss in the 2020 election . \nwhen she wasn \u2019 t spreading noxious conspiracy theories , the activist was attempting to beat back the would be labeled criminals , rounded up , and tossed in jail if gay people had rights . \nshe also trumpeted \u201c conversion therapy , \u201d a range of dangerous and discredited practices meant to change one \u2019 s sexual orientation , and was labeled the \u201c the architect of the \u2018 conversion therapy \u2019 campagin \u201d by the new york times . \nthe activist , purportedly so concerned about the lives of children , even served as a spokeswoman for roy moore , the former alabama chief justice who unsuccessfully ran for accused of child molestation and attacking the woman who accused him . \nat the heart of porter \u2019 s activism is an effort to spread a fundamentalist version of christianity . \nin 2010 , her views became so extreme that VCY , the christian radio station broadcasting her show , canceled it , citing \u201c the drift of the program toward \u2018 dominion \u2019 theology \u201d \u2014 that is , the idea that christians are called to take complete control over every aspect of human life in order to bring about the return of life : abortion and women \u2019 s bodies . \nand so in 2011 , porter , working as the head of anti - choice group faith2action , found an ohio state legislator , rep. lynn wachtmann , R - napoleon , to champion legislation she had drafted to restrict access to abortion . \nthe ohio bill was the first \u201c heartbeat bill \u201d of its kind and so extreme \u2014 limiting abortion at the detection of a \u201c heartbeat , \u201d making no exceptions for incest or rape \u2014 that other anti - choice groups and legislators balked at it . \nquestioning the wondered whether the legislation would do more harm than good for their cause . \nsupporters of the bill said incremental steps weren \u2019 t working and were eager to directly challenge roe . \nporter herself was explicit about her goal , stating in 2017 , that her \u201c heartbeat bill \u201d was \u201c the foot in the door \u201d to totally outlawing abortion . \u201c \nit was not my original idea , but I \u2019 ve been a pro - life leader here in columbus for 26 years , and I \u2019 m committed to can go to protect human life , and that \u2019 s clearly what this bill is all about , \u201d wachtmann stated in february 2011 shortly before he introduced the bill . \nat that point , faith2action already had a full - throttle pressure campaign underway to get the legislation passed . \nunder porter \u2019 s leadership , the group urged its supporters to send heart - shaped red balloons to the ohio governor and state representatives ahead of valentine \u2019 s day , \u201c encouraging their support of the heartbeat bill \u201d and to \u201c have repeated in a column for the far - right WND site . \nthe bill passed in the state house later that year . \nwhen the legislation stalled in the state senate in 2012 , faith2action took out a full - page ad in the columbus dispatch and made thousands of robocalls asking its supporters to contact state senators . \nthat ad featured dr. john willke , founder of the national right to life and another sponsor of the bill . \nrevered in anti - abortion rights circles , willke had perpetuated the false myth that a woman \u2019 s which may be among the reasons why the bill did not provide exceptions for abortion in case of rape . \nanother is that porter doesn \u2019 t think women should be allowed to have any abortion , stating in 2017 , \u201c we \u2019 re not for killing any child , especially an innocent child for the crime of his father . \u201d \nthe bill had wide support among religious - right figures both in state and out of state . \nan archived version of faith2action \u2019 s site for the bill lists E.W . \njackson james robison , rick joyner , wendy wright , ken blackwell , jay sekulow , tony perkins , james dobson , and frank pavone as supporters . \nit also featured a list of current and former elected officials : former texas gov . \nrick perry , former arkansas gov . \nmike huckabee , rep. jim jordan ( then an ohio state legislator ) , rep. louie gohmert , former sen. rick santorum , former speaker of the house newt gingrich , former rep. michele bachmann , then rep. steve king , and former the bill did reach then gov . \njohn kasich , he vetoed it twice , preferring to sign another strict abortion ban at 12 weeks and citing constitutionality issues with the \u201c heartbeat \u201d legislation . \nbut the bill found a champion in his republican successor , gov . \nmike dewine , who signed ohio \u2019 s \u201c heartbeat bill \u201d into law in 2019 before planned parenthood and abortion clinics represented by the american civil liberties union sued . \nA federal judge issued a temporary stay on the abortion ban and extended of red states followed suit , passing their own \u201c heartbeat \u201d abortion bans . \nthe legislation mostly faced the same fate as the ohio law \u2014 that is , except for texas . \nthe texas law provides a loophole those others did not : instead of the state attorney general or other state officials enforcing the law , the law explicitly prevents state governments from enforcing it and essentially deputizes every citizen to sue anyone who performs an abortion or aids a woman in getting one . \nthat leaves abortion clinics at a loss by the law \u2019 s drafters : to prevent intervention from federal courts . \nso when the supreme court had a chance to stay the legislation , the conservative majority essentially said that the nation \u2019 s top court had its hands tied , that abortion providers in the state had not addressed the \u201c complex and novel \u201d procedural questions and would have to do so before the supreme court would take it up . \nthe texas law also provides a bounty to incentivize enforcement : any person who successfully sues would covered . \ndefendants who are successful are not entitled to have their legal fees covered , and anyone who aided a woman in getting an abortion could be sued multiple times . \nthe effect is that most if not all clinics in the state have stopped providing abortions after six weeks for fear of bankruptcy . \nthe texas law was sponsored by texas state sen. bryan hughes , who asked conservative litigator jonathan F. mitchell how anti - abortion legislation could avoid the fate of other \u201c heartbeat bills \u201d that languished without enforcement after a former texas solicitor general and active member of the federalist society , was already steeped in the religious - right effort to overturn roe , representing towns sued by the ACLU over their ordinances that made abortion a crime . \nin 2017 , while working alongside with alliance defending freedom on a case about religious freedom , he trotted out a theory that he \u2019 d go on to use in texas , claiming that no matter how unconstitutional a law was , if it did not charge a state official with the duty produce a federal lawsuit . \nmitchell would become the primary architect of the texas abortion law \u2019 s private - enforcement provision . \u201c \nwe knew we had to have another way , \u201d said hughes , according to the wall street journal . \u201c \nwe were going to find a way to pass a heartbeat bill that was going to be upheld . \u201d \nit \u2019 s unclear how much porter , who was a supporter of the texas law , had to do with this particular loophole , but the drafters of that particular the \u201c heartbeat bill \u201d to thank and the religious right \u2019 s decades - long campaign to overturn roe of which she was a part . \nnational religious - right organizations , like ADF , have championed a state - by - state approach to chip away at the landmark legislation . \nthis spring , the supreme court announced it will hear a case about a mississippi law banning abortions at 15 weeks , a law that was based on ADF \u2019 s model legislation and a major threat to a woman \u2019 s right to an abortion . \nbut as big of a blow to roe as has porter \u2019 s \u201c heartbeat \u201d legislation . \nalready , other states are considering a law based on texas \u2019 version of the \u201c heartbeat bill . \u201d \nas she celebrated last wednesday , porter , too , looked forward . \u201c \nthe national association of christian lawmakers just adopted the texas version of the heartbeat law as their model legislation , \u201d she said , a smile dancing across her face between sentences . \u201c \nthat means we \u2019 re about to see a actually get enforced . \u201d \n"}, {"id": 182, "body": "MOSCOW ( reuters ) -

showed no interest in doing anything short of overruling it . \nsign up for the morning newsletter from the new york times then , on friday , those same five justices allowed a texas law that bans most abortions after six weeks to remain in place and seemed to shut down any effective way to challenge it in federal court . \nthat law , 1 , is flatly at odds with roe , which established a constitutional right to abortion and prohibited states from banning the procedure before fetal viability , or around 23 weeks of pregnancy . \nA decision in the mississippi case is not expected until late june . \nif the court overrules roe , an increasingly real possibility , it will have to explain why it is departing from the principle of stare decisis , which is legal latin for \u201c to stand by things decided . \u201d \nat his 2005 confirmation hearings , chief should be wary of overturning precedents , in part because doing so threatens the court \u2019 s legitimacy . \u201c \nit is a

, the court has said , \u201c the quality of the decision \u2019 s reasoning . \u201d \nat the argument in the mississippi case , concerning a state law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks in an

an issue in the case ? \u201d \nhe asked . \u201c \nI know it wasn \u2019 t briefed or argued . \u201d \nin shifting the focus from what the court had done to what the parties in the case had asked it to do , the chief justice was trying to justify upholding a 15 - week line while stopping would allow states to make all abortions illegal . \nwhatever his goal , though , shifting the analysis from the words of the opinion to the advocacy that gave rise to it is a recent development and yet another way to undermine precedents . \nrichard J. lazarus , a law professor at harvard , explored this mode of argument in a recent article in the supreme court review called \u201c advocacy history in the supreme court . \u201d \nthe article makes the sensible point that a full understanding of a

been presented to the court . \nin 2007 , in an opinion limiting the use of race in assigning students to public schools to achieve integration , roberts made a similar move . \nA key precedent in that case was brown v. board of education , the 1954 decision banning racial segregation in public schools . \nthe chief justice wrote that his 2007 opinion was \u201c faithful to the heritage \u201d

\nin 2010 professor thomas hertel of purdue university gave the agricultural and applied economics association . \nhe chose to discuss the ability of mathematical models like GAPS to predict future supplies ( this work was subsequently published as hertel , 2011 ) . \nhertel told his audience that those models are faulty . \nwhat hertel highlighted is that economic analysis has plainly shown that food supplies respond to long - term prices . \nthat is , when prices for food items increase , food production also increases . \nfor example , when prices increase , it becomes more worthwhile for farmers to invest in boosting low there is little such incentive . \nother actors in the food system behave similarly . \nyet global food models , noted hertel , have adopted the opposite interpretation : they assume global food supplies are insensitive to prices . \nin the firm but diplomatic tone expected of a presidential address , hertel told his audience : \u201c I fear that much of this rich knowledge has not yet worked its way into the global models being used for long run analysis of climate , biofuels and agricultural land use \u2026 \u2026 it is not clear the kind of long run sustainability analysis envisioned here . \u201d \nthis is rather important . \nsince the whole point of these models is long - term prediction , if global food models underestimate the ability of food systems to adjust to higher demand , they will tend to predict a crisis even when there isn \u2019 t one . \nlike all mathematical models , GAPS and other food system models incorporate numerous assumptions . \nthese assumptions are typically shared across related models , which is why they tend to give similar answers . \nthe reliability on the validity of shared assumptions like the one hertel focused on . \nhertel \u2019 s analysis therefore prompts two important questions . \nthe first is this : if GAPS contains an assumption that contradicts the collective wisdom of conventional agricultural economics , what other questionable assumptions hide in global food models ? \nsurprisingly though , given the stakes , scarcely any attention has been devoted to rigorous independent testing of these crucial assumptions ( scrieciu , 2007 ; reilly and willenbockel , 2010 ; wise , 2013 ; lapp\u00e9 and collins , this : is it significant that the error identified by hertel will tend to generate predictions that are unnecessarily alarmist ? \nin a new peer - reviewed paper , the myth of a food crisis , I have critiqued FAO \u2019 s GAPS \u2013 and by extension all similar food system models \u2013 at the level of these , often unstated , assumptions ( latham , 2021 ) . \nthe myth of a food crisis identifies four assumptions in food system models that are especially problematic since they have major effects on the reliability of are : 1 ) that biofuels are driven by \u201c demand \u201d . \nas the paper shows , biofuels are incorporated into GAPS on the demand side of equations . \nhowever , biofuels derive from lobbying efforts . \nthey exist to solve the problem of agricultural oversupply ( baines , 2015 ) . \nsince biofuels contribute little or nothing to sustainability , land used for them is available to feed populations if needed . \nthis potential availability ( e.g . \n40 % of US corn is used for corn ethanol ) makes it as an unavoidable demand on production . \n2 ) that current agricultural production systems are optimized for productivity . \nas the paper also shows , agricultural systems are typically not optimised to maximise calories or nutrients . \nusually , they optimise profits ( or sometimes subsidies ) , with very different results . \nfor this reason , practically all agricultural systems could produce many more nutrients per acre at no ecological cost if desired . \n3 ) that crop \u201c yield potentials \u201d have been correctly estimated . \nusing the example of rice , even under sub - optimal conditions , achieve yields far in excess of those considered possible by GAPS . \nthus the yield ceilings assumed by GAPS are far too low for rice and probably other crops too . \ntherefore GAPS grossly underestimates agricultural potential . \n4 ) that annual global food production is approximately equal to global food consumption . \nas the paper also shows , a significant proportion of annual global production ends up in storage where it degrades and is disposed of without ever being counted by GAPS . \nthere is thus . \nthe specific ways in which these four assumptions are incorporated into GAPS and other models produces one of two effects . \neach causes GAPS to either underestimate global food supply ( now and in the future ) , or to overestimate global food demand ( now and in the future ) . \nthus GAPS and other models underestimate supply and exaggerate demand . \nthe cumulative effect is dramatic . \nusing peer - reviewed data , the discrepancy between food availability estimated by GAPS and the underlying supply is calculated in the paper . \nsuch omit approximately enough food annually to feed 12.5 billion persons . \nthat is a lot of food , but it does perfectly explain why the models are so discrepant with policymakers \u2019 and farmers \u2019 consistent experiences of the food system . \nthe consequences of this analysis are very significant on a number of fronts . \nthere is no global shortage of food . \neven under any plausible future population scenario or potential increases in wealth , the current global glut will not disappear due to elevated demand . \namong the many implications being equal , global commodity prices will continue to decline . \nthe potential caveat to this is climate chaos . \nclimate consequences are not factored into this analysis . \nhowever , for people who think that industrial agriculture is the solution to that problem , it is worth recalling that industrialised food systems are the leading emitter of carbon dioxide . \nindustrialising food production is therefore not the solution to climate change \u2013 \u00ad it is the problem . \nanother significant implication of this analysis is to remove the justification for the ( frequently \u2018 sustainable intensification \u2019 measures featuring intensive use of pesticides , gmos , and gene edited organisms to boost food production ( wilson , 2021 ) . \nwhat is needed to save rainforests and other habitats from agricultural expansion is instead to reduce the subsidies and incentives that are responsible for overproduction and unsustainable practices ( capellesso et al . , \n2016 ) . \nin this way , harmful agricultural policies can be replaced by ones guided by criteria such as ecological sustainability and cultural appropriateness . \nA second implication stems from asking : levels , why are critics largely absent ? \nthomas hertel \u2019 s critique should have rung alarm bells . \nthe short answer is that the philanthropic and academic sectors in agriculture and development are corrupt . \nthe form this corruption takes is not illegality \u2013 rather that , with important exceptions , these sectors do not serve the public interest , but their own interests . \nA good example is the FAO , which created GAPS . \nthe primary mandate of FAO is to enable food production \u2013 its motto is fiat panis food crisis there would hardly be a need for an FAO . \nmany philanthropic and academic institutions are equally conflicted . \nit is no accident that all the critics mentioned above are relative or complete outsiders . \ntoo many participants in the food system depend on a crisis narrative . \nbut the biggest factor of all in promotion of the crisis narrative is agribusiness . \nagribusiness is the entity most threatened by its exposure . \nit is agribusiness that perpetuates the myth most actively and makes best use of it by endlessly championing starvation . \nit is agribusiness that most aggressively alleges that all other forms of agriculture are inadequate ( peekhaus , 2010 ) . \nthis malthusian spectre is a good story , it \u2019 s had a tremendous run , but it \u2019 s just not true . \nby exposing it , we can free up agriculture to work for everyone . \nalexandratos , N. , & bruinsma , J .

wage , transition jobs funded by the government and managed by the local community . \nthis labor would act as a buffer stock in in the economy . \nsupport for MMT grew in large part thanks to the internet , where economists explained the theory on popular personal and group blogs , the idea of a trillion - dollar coin was widely discussed and supporters shared a clip of former fed chair alan greenspan saying pay - as - you - go benefits aren \u2019 t insecure because \u201c there \u2019 s nothing to prevent the federal government from creating as much money as it wants and paying it to somebody . \u201d \ntax revenues are not used for government funding under MMT , similar to pay for its expenses . \nrather , taxes are used to control inflation . \nA widely disliked tax policy among many is increasing taxes , which is why snyder says the bearish case for MMT is \u201c taxes never go up because they \u2019 re unpopular and inflation runs rampant . \u201d \nbut this is a fundamental principle of MMT : when there is too much demand in the economy , taxes must be raised to subdue demand . \nMMT begins with the government budget constraint under a system of fiat money . \naccording ( hereafter MW & W ) , the standard approach , which relates the present value of tax revenue to the present value of government spending and the government debt , is misleading . \nthey write , \u201c the most important conclusion reached by MMT is that the issuer of a currency faces no financial constraints . \nput simply , a country that issues its own currency can never run out and can never become insolvent in its own currency . \nit can make all payments as they come due . \u201d ( \nMW a result , \u201c for most governments , there is no default risk on government debt . \u201d ( \nMW & W , p. 15 ) WHY CAN \u2019 T YOU JUST PRINT MONEY ? \nfirst , in our current monetary system with interest paid on reserves , any money the government prints to pay a bill will likely end up in the banking system as reserves , and the government ( via the fed ) will need to pay interest on those reserves . \nthat is , when the government prints money to in effect , borrowing . \nthe money can stay as reserves forever , but interest accrues over time . \nan MMT proponent will point out that the interest can be paid by printing yet more money . \nbut the ever - expanding monetary base will have further ramifications . \naggregate demand will increase due to a wealth effect , eventually spurring inflation . \nsecond , if sufficient interest is not paid on reserves , the expansion in the monetary base will increase bank lending and the money supply . \ninterest rates must then fall to supply , again putting upward pressure on aggregate demand and inflation . \nthird , the increase in inflation reduces the real quantity of money demanded . \nthis fall in real money balances , in turn , reduces the real resources that the government can claim via money creation . \nindeed , there is likely a laffer curve for seigniorage . \nA government that acts as if it has no financial constraints may quickly find itself on the wrong side of this laffer curve , where the ability to print money has little value circumstances , a government may decide that defaulting on its debts is the best option , despite its ability to create more money . \nthat is , government default may occur not because it is inevitable but because it is preferable to hyperinflation . \nthis discussion brings us to the theory of inflation . \nI have been adopting the mainstream view , explained most simply by the quantity theory of money , that a high rate of money creation is inflationary . \nproponents of MMT question that conclusion . \nthey assert that \u201c in the money supply and rises in the general price level . \u201d ( \nMW & W , p. 263 ) this assertion overstates the case against the mainstream view . \nin U.S. decade data since 1870 , the correlation between inflation and money growth is 0.79 . \ncross -

cortez , the democratic socialist from the bronx who \u2019 s in her first term in congress , supports the job guarantee and says MMT should be \u201c a larger part of our conversation . \u201d \nMMT challenges a core principle of conventional economics , which is that an increase in budget deficits will tend to raise interest rates opposite , it says , sounding a bit like the white queen from alice in wonderland . \nwhen the government spends more , the private sector gets the money and puts it in the banking system . \nwith more money in the system and no increase in demand for it , interest rates will tend to fall , not rise , MMT says . \nthat is , unless the government chooses to soak up reserves by selling bonds , which it doesn \u2019 t have to do . \nthe reason the government doesn , or levy taxes , to spend money is that the central bank , under the control of the treasury , can pay for everything by conjuring up electronic money . \nin MMT \u2019 s ideal world there would still be taxes , but their main purpose , aside from lessening inequality , would be as \u201c offsets \u201d to keep inflation under control . \ntaxes would drain just enough money from consumers and businesses so total spending in the economy won \u2019 t be excessive . \nmmters hold that inflation isn \u2019 growth . \nthey blame much of it on businesses \u2019 excessive pricing power . \nso before trying to choke off growth to kill inflation , they would try to break up monopolies and stop banks from making too many loans . \u201c \nthe more actively we regulate big business for public purpose , the tighter the full employment we can achieve , \u201d three mmters wrote in a letter to the financial times \u2019 alphaville column that was published on march 1 . \nMMT \u2019 s critics argue that trying to use fiscal proven failure because congress and the president rarely act quickly enough to respond to a downturn . \nand they say politicians can \u2019 t be relied upon to impose pain on the public through higher taxes or lower spending to squelch rising inflation . \nmmters respond that they also oppose fine - tuning and instead want to use automatic stabilizers \u2014 including the jobs guarantee \u2014 to keep the economy on track . \nSTEPHANIE KELTON ( MMT , ADVISOR TO SANDERS : kelton wrote the article \u201c congress can give every american a pony ( if it breeds enough the los angeles times . \u201d \ncritics of MMT reject its reassurance that a country with its own currency doesn \u2019 t need to worry about deficits . \nafter all , it \u2019 s been proven that a nation that loses the confidence of the world \u2019 s investors will see its currency plummet . \nas recently as 1976 , the U.K. was forced to appeal to the international monetary fund to stabilize the value of sterling . \nMMT argues that by insisting the government rein in its spending to \u201c balance its books a lack of investment , an underperforming economy , and all the unemployment and lost opportunities that go along with that . \ninstead , MMT says , the government ought to be able to create all the new money it needs as long as that does not generate inflation . \nto understand where MMT is coming from , it \u2019 s useful to start with two recent occasions when chairmen of the US federal reserve admitted that the government can print all the money it needs , and nothing bad happens . \ncentral , which is why the statements are so interesting . \nif creating new money out of thin air creates inflation , why was there no inflation when ben bernanke created $ 1 trillion in assets to save the banks during the financial crisis ? ( \n$ 1 trillion is actually the lower end of the bailout estimate . \nA paper by the levy economic institute argued the cost was as high as $ 29 trillion . ) \njapan runs a deficit of 240 % of GDP , and yet has no inflation in , and the 19 countries in the euro currency area , imposed negative interest rates to flush money out of bank accounts , in hopes of generating inflation . \nat the same time , the european central bank hosed the continent with \u20ac 2.5 trillion ( $ 2.5 trillion ) in \u201c quantitive easing \u201d ( new money , but with a fancy name ) . \nZIMBABWE : \u201c of course if you keep spending and you can \u2019 t produce goods to meet that spending you \u2019 ll get inflation , and if you \u2019 ll get hyperinflation , \u201d he says . \nit is the lack of goods \u2014 or labour , or capacity \u2014 that triggers inflation , MMT argues . \nthat \u2019 s why there was no inflation in the west in the last 10 years . \nall that extra money from the fed and the ECB was put to use , making the recession slightly less awful than it could have been . \nthere are still people without jobs , and plenty of unused \u201c capacity , \u201d in the US and remains the case it is unlikely that inflation will happen . \u201c \nthe existence of unemployment is clear de facto evidence that net government spending is too small to move the economy to full employment , \u201d wrote phil armstrong of york college in 2015 . \u201c [ \nthe government ] must use its position as a monopoly issuer of the currency to ensure full employment . \u201d \nwhen the private sector fails to provide full employment , MMT advocates support the idea of a \u201c jobs guarantee \u201d that provides government - funded jobs to the spending on such a program would be capped when the economy reaches full employment . \u201c \nwhen do you know that the government has spent enough ? \nwhen the last worker has walked into a job guarantee office to pick up a job , \u201d says mitchell . \nforms of federal job guarantees have existed in the past . \nin 2002 , argentina introduced the jefes programme , which offered a job to the head of every household and paid a basic wage . \njefes participants worked on local community projects such and community centers ; baking , sewing clothing , and recycling ; and repairing sewers and sidewalks . \nin 1933 , president franklin roosevelt began rolling out his \u201c new deal , \u201d which provided a wage to unemployed people to build schools , hospitals , airports , roads , bridges and other infrastructure . \nand during world war 2 most western governments spent heavily on military and armaments to finance the war . \ntraditional economists regard this type of thinking as highly inflationary and damaging to free markets . \nif the government takes to buy up all the unemployed labour , then the private sector will be starved of workers . \nemployees will be pulled out of productive , efficient , market - driven companies into inefficient government jobs . \nwage inflation will spiral as the government \u2019 s new money pours in and workers demand higher pay in the private sector . \nalthough the stereotype of MMT is about inflationary spending , the reality is that MMT - ers take inflation very seriously . \nat full employment , except for imports , the economy \u2019 s resources are wray . \nany further spending will be inflationary . \nit \u2019 s not the money that \u2019 s the problem . \nit \u2019 s whether the economy has enough people and goods to supply the demand that cash creates . \nMMT - ers also propose that tax policy should become an anti - inflationary monetary tool . \nif there is too much money in the economy the government should tax some of it , thereby taking it out of circulation . ( \nwhen you pay taxes , the money is literally destroyed , mosler says . \u201c \ndebit your account and those funds are gone . \njust like shutting off a light switch . \nif you somehow paid with actual cash with old paper bills , they would send them to be shredded . \nyou can buy shredded dollars online . \u201d ) \nMMT - ers argue that the \u201c household \u201d metaphor is exactly backwards , because the government has to create the money first in order to spend it , and only after it is in circulation can it be taxed back . \nfour reasons the government is obviously not like its own money and set the price at which that money is available to the markets . \nit therefore has monopoly power on the fundamental underlying prices of everything in the economy . \nany debts denominated in its own currency can be paid with its own currency , or can be settled by the creation of new money in that currency . \u2022 \nthe government creates money in order to spend it , according to mosler . \nthe government does not impose taxes in order to find money , in other words . \u201d \nand \u201c creation \u201d might as well be the same thing , in the MMT framework . \u2022 \ntaxes make money valuable . \nmoney is only valuable when a government has the power to command that taxes be paid in the currency it operates . \nif everyone has to pay tax , then everyone needs to earn money . \nA government can create all the money it wants , and it can also tax back all the money it wants , keeping prices stable . \nthe government thus has two levers to can vary taxes and spending , up or down , in concert or independently . \u2022 \nthe government need not balance its books the way a household does . \ngovernments create and spend money but they do not tax back 100 % of that cash . \nthat \u2019 s why , at any given time , a government will be running a deficit . \nthe deficit is merely the difference between all the cash the government has spent and all the taxes it has collected . \nA deficit signifies that the private sector the difference . \nso if the government is in deficit the flipside is that the private sector is in surplus . \nsimilarly , if the government is in surplus it must mean that the private folks are in deficit \u2014 using debt or their savings to get by , because total payments to the government are more than the government \u2019 s spending . \neven if everything MMT proposed were true , and money creation and deficit spending were not inflationary at the national level , runaway inflation might still kick in if to make your nation \u2019 s currency worthless , your government bankrupt , and your central bank default . \npolitical bias : if the central bank follows the government \u2019 s direction , it could face accusations of political bias or corruption , erode people \u2019 s trust in financial regulators , and struggle to make painful decisions in the short term that benefit the economy in the long term . \ncentral banks in venezuela , zimbabwe , and argentina all printed money to please politicians in recent years \u2014 resulting in hyperinflation : the government might not spot when the economy has reached full capacity , or lack the discipline to stop spending , leading to inflation . \npolitically impractical : relying on taxation to extract money from the economy and cool it down could well be politically infeasible in countries where tax hikes are deeply unpopular , such as the US . \nif households are feeling the pinch of higher prices , politicians might be more inclined to cut their taxes than raise them . \ntax policy already has an important role : tax money from the wealthy to the poor . \nrepurposing it to reduce the money supply could mean those effects are overlooked . \nforeign debt : if the government holds a significant amount of debt in another currency , printing money and depreciating its currency could make that debt harder to pay off and even force it to default . \nFX markets maybe skeptical : printing money with reckless abandon could also make investors wary of currency volatility and inflation , leading them to ditch the currency for foreign exchange , gold , and @ \n"}, {"id": 200, "body": "new york democrat representative alexandria ocasio -

\u201c \nI don \u2019 t have an answer to [ that ] . \u201d \nhe said . \nbut he wasn \u2019 t fussed by it . \nhe asked if I \u2019 d have a problem if people in the NML worked with the american military . \nthe two situations are not comparable , I said . \u201c \ncanada and the US are allies and we protect the north american continent together . \nchina is not a friend of canada . \u201d \nand I am not alone , 2021 , the director of CSIS , david vigneault , gave a public talk in which he described china as a \u201c strategic threat . \u201d \n229 but wagener saw things differently . \npathogenic agents can be looked at with two eyes , he said , from the point of view of public health , but also from a safety and security perspective , biowarfare and bioterrorism . \u201c \nalmost any country with a level 4 will have an interest in these agents in a military perspective . \nyou prepare your armed forces weapon against troops . \njust by publishing it , it tells you this knowledge is in the public domain . \u201d \nwhat he meant is that , if something is published , it no longer constitutes a threat . \neverybody can read it . \nI wasn \u2019 t so sure about that . \nand it raised another question : had all the experiments done in the NML lab by qiu and cheng , along with chinese military personnel , been published ? \nand did the two of them retain their access to data even from what wagener said of the NML \u2019 s clearance process , it seemed to me more than possible that the security investigation of keding cheng and xiangguo qiu had been less than rigorous . \nas wagener had also explained , people working in level 4 labs organize their work so that they don \u2019 t have to be inside them any longer than necessary . \nthe bulk of experimental protocols are conducted safely in labs with lesser containment . \npeople coming from china to work with qiu might not have needed security someone in the lab who did have one . \nI went back to google scholar . \nI wanted to find out exactly when qiu and cheng began working with co- authors from the chinese military , the wuhan institute of virology , and with george gao . \nI dug out qiu \u2019 s paper on treating ebola in nonhuman primates with \u201c zmapp . \u201d \nit had been published in nature online in august 2014 , in final form in october . \nshe was the lead author , kobinger the last , larry zeitlin , such as gene olinger , were affiliated with the NIH , still others with the united states army medical research institute of infectious diseases at frederick , maryland . \nbut there was one author , heiyan wei , who was affiliated with both the NML and the institute of infectious diseases , henan center for disease control , china . \nthis seemed odd given that money for this paper had come from the US defense threat reduction agency , the US national institutes of health , PHAC , and the canadian safety for a chinese state - run institution qualify for a canadian security clearance ? \nand if not , how could heiyan wei have been affiliated with the NML ? \nI found another paper co - authored by george gao which appeared to be the first xiangguo qiu published with him . \nit was called \u201c molecular characterization of the monoclonal antibodies composing zmab : A protective cocktail against ebola virus . \u201d \nit was submitted to scientific reports in september 2014 , just as the nature piece appeared online . \nit was published in november , just after form . \nkobinger was one of the co - authors . \ngao and two others were with the CAS key laboratory of pathogenic microbiology and immunology , institute of microbiology , chinese academy of sciences , beijing . \nqiu was the corresponding author.231 the acknowledgements said the NML authors were supported by the canadian safety and security program , while george F. gao was supported by two grants from the government of china , the china national grand S & T special project , and the special foundation of president for ebola virus research from credited , along with the other colleagues from china , with performing the \u201c surface plasmon resonance assay and data analysis . \u201d \ngary kobinger was credited with writing the paper . \nthat same year , contrary to amir attaran \u2019 s assertion that gain - of - function experiments are permissible in canada but not done , qiu and kobinger did a gain - of - function/ passaging experiment at the NML involving mice and marburg . \nthe paper was called \u201c establishment and characterization of a lethal mouse model for the angola strain of marburg virus . \u201d \nmarburg normally does passages in immunodeficient mice it adapted itself sufficiently to give the mice severe disease . \nthe money for that experiment also came from the canadian safety and security program , but no one affiliated with a chinese institution worked on it.232 but when qiu and gary wong did a similar experiment in 2015 that entailed making guinea pigs susceptible to sudan virus by adapting the virus to them through multiple passages , heiyan wei of the henan center for disease control and prevention , china , was again a co - author.233 A paper published and makona strains of ebola in rhesus macaques . \ngary wong worked on that paper as first author . \ngeorge gao worked on it too.234 I found three articles focused on the creation of devices for rapid detection of ebola . \ngeorge gao was a co - author on all three . \nthe first appeared in the journal biosensors and bioelectronics , and the other two in analytical chemistry . \nthe biosensors paper was published at the end of 2015.235 the first analytical chemistry paper appeared in december 2016 , the next in may 2018 papers was jianjun chen of the laboratory of special pathogens and biosafety at the wuhan institute of virology , where shi zhengli was deputy director.236 gary wong worked on those papers too . \nhe was no longer affiliated with the NML but with the same institutes in china as george gao : one in shenzhen , one in beijing.237 the only co - author from the NML on the may 2018 paper was xiangguo qiu . \nbut work with ebola must have been done at the NML . \nit could not be done in china the latter had not yet received permission to import ebola to china . \nand what about the chinese military ? \nmembers of the military began working with xiangguo qiu about a year after george gao . \nI found a paper titled \u201c an adenovirus vaccine expressing ebola virus variant makona glycoprotein is efficacious in guinea pigs and nonhuman primates . \u201d \nit was published online on october 4 , 2016 , in the journal of infectious diseases.238 the first author , shipo wu , was affiliated with the beijing institute of biotechnology , an chinese military . \nseveral other co - authors were with the same institute . \nthe most important among them was chen wei . \nher name is given on the paper as wei chen , but that \u2019 s the western way of naming in which the family name comes last ; in china it \u2019 s the other way around . \nchen wei , china \u2019 s lead expert on ebola , had made the vaccine used in the study . \nshe was then and still is a major general in the people \u2019 s not mentioned in this paper . \nxiangguo qiu , the last author , was said to be with both the special pathogens program at the NML and with the university of manitoba . \ngary wong was listed with both the NML and the CAS key laboratory of pathogenic microbiology and immunology , institute of microbiology , chinese academy of sciences special pathogens program , which was george gao \u2019 s home institution . \ntwo other co - authors , xuefeng yu and tao zhu , were with tianjin - based cansino biologics inc.239 xuefeng yu came to mainly at sanofi , the pharmaceutical company , until 2009 . \nhe returned to china and set up cansino to develop vaccines . \nit is now listed on the hong kong stock exchange . \nthe cell line used to develop major general chen wei \u2019 s ebola vaccine is a variant on an original cell line crafted long ago by dr. frank graham of mcmaster university . \nthe national research council ( NRC ) licensed its use to cansino . \nthis same cell line was used again by major general chen wei to fight SARS - cov-2 . \ncanada was supposed to have gotten access to that SARS - cov-2 vaccine for phase 1 trials , along with the right to manufacture it at an NRC plant being adapted for vaccine production in montreal . \nbut in may 2020 , shortly after this deal was announced , it fell apart , a fact not shared with canadians until august . \nchinese authorities would not permit the vaccine to be sent to canada at all ( adding vaccine diplomacy to hostage diplomacy in china \u2019 s bag of pressure tactics ) a special prize for her SARS - cov-2 efforts ( not for the vaccine , but for a plasma treatment ) in a heavily publicized ceremony hosted by xi jinping himself . \nif you google her name , you \u2019 ll find an image of her resplendent in her military uniform with a very large decoration , like a mayor \u2019 s chain of office , hung over her shoulders . \nshe is standing beside president xi.241 there are several laudatory stories about her in the chinese press , the kind that aim to show combating the virus . \nshe told state broadcaster CCTV that \u201c the pandemic is a military affair , and the affected areas are the war zones . \u201d \nI also found a lovely picture of her being tossed in the air by her african colleagues during the west african ebola epidemic of 2014\u20132016 , as if to celebrate her efforts in helping to stem the outbreak . \nxiangguo qiu tested chen \u2019 s ebola vaccine at the NML on guinea pigs and nonhuman primates : they were infected with ebola to get a better . \nto do such experiments in china , major general chen wei would have needed access to a BSL-4 lab , but the new BSL-4 at the wuhan institute of virology was not yet finished so ebola experiments couldn \u2019 t be done there . \nthe acknowledgements on the vaccine paper said that xiangguo qiu , lihua huo , and their colleague wei chen \u2014 chen wei \u2014 had conceived and designed the study . \nfunding came from the public health agency of canada , cansino biologics , and the institute of biotechnology in beijing . , \nwhen this experiment began , xiangguo qiu was already working with george gao , the wuhan institute of virology , and the chinese military medical establishment at the highest level . \neither the public health agency of canada approved these relationships or it just never noticed that china \u2019 s leading military expert on viruses with pandemic potential was using canada \u2019 s only BSL-4 lab for china \u2019 s purposes . \nand where was CSIS ( canadian security intelligence services ) in all of this ?

\nthe open letter explains in detail the structural and functional limitations of the WHO - china wuhan collaborative team : exclusive chinese field work , lack of complete access to lab installations or databases , consensus process in report making \u2026 A credible investigation would have had terms of reference that : 1 ) acknowledged the possibility of laboratory origin , 2 ) ensured access of investigators to facilities at the wuhan laboratories that handle bat SARS - related coronaviruses , 3 ) enabled collection of evidence , not mere meet - and - greet photo - ops , 4 ) authorized an investigation of months , not mere days . \nand 5 ) A credible investigation also would have had conflict - of - interest - free investigators , not persons who were subjects of the research and/or closely associated with subjects of the investigation . \nyou have said several times that this WHO mission was literally \u201c a charade \u201d . \nyes , its members were willing \u2013 and , in at least one the pre - negotiated \u201c terms of reference \u201d for the WHO study did not even acknowledge the possibility of a laboratory origin of the virus and did not even mention the wuhan institute of virology ( WIV ) , the wuhan center for disease control ( CDC ) or the wuhan institute of biological products . \nregarding the inspection personnel , at least one member of the WHO mission team , ecohealth alliance president dr. peter daszak , seems to have conflicts of interest that should have disqualified him from being part of an pandemic . \nyes . \ndaszak was the contractor who funded the laboratory at WIV that potentially was the source of the virus ( with subcontracts from $ 200 million from the US department of state and $ 7 million from the US national institutes of health ) , and he was a collaborator and co - author on research projects at the laboratory . \nthe open letter also lists the elements of \u201c what a full investigation should look like \u201d . \nso again , dr. ebright , if you where in charge of a origins of the pandemic : what would you like to see first ? \nwhat kind of questions would you ask and to who ? \nA credible forensic investigation would require access to records , samples , personnel , and facilities at WIV , the wuhan CDC and the wuhan institute of biological products . \nit would entail inspection of electronic and paper records , inspection of freezer and refrigerator samples , environmental sampling of facilities , and confidential interviews with personnel \u2013 including previous and current construction , maintenance , janitorial , disposal , security personnel . \nwhenever asked if this virus could have leaked from the wuhan institute of virology , your answer has been : \u201c yes ( \u2026 ) this can not and should not be dismissed \u201d . \nA study on COVID origin of dr. steven quay , another signer of the open letter , calculates the lab hypotheses to be a 99.8 % probability . \nat this point in time , there is no secure basis to assign relative probabilities to the natural - accident hypothesis and the laboratory - accident hypothesis . \nbut given the fact what chance do you give for a natural zoonotic origin of this pandemic ? \nat this point in time , all scientific data related to the genome sequence of SARS - cov-2 and the epidemiology of COVID-19 are equally consistent with a natural - accident origin or a laboratory - accident origin . \nwhat would you say to the scientist who declined to comment on the open letter because it does not come from virologists ? \nthere were virologists among the signers of the open letter . \nthere even were coronavirologists among the signers of the open letter . \non the planet . \nnot just virologists . \ndr. ebright , you are a microbiologist and molecular biologist , what light can you shed on this matter from your fields of expertise ? \nmicrobiologists and molecular biologists are as qualified as virologists to assess the relevant science and science policies . \nvirology is a subset , not a superset , of microbiology and molecular biology . \nthe sequencing , sequence analysis , cell culture , animal - infection studies , and other laboratory procedures used by virologists are not materially different from the procedures used I guess that is why the second point of the open letter research proposal is precisely to create a multidisciplinary team . \nit is crucial that any team reviewing the issues include not only research scientists , but also biosafety , biosecurity , and science policy specialists . \nwhat biological evidence regarding the structure and behaviour of SARS - cov-2 points to a pure zoonosis ? \nand what to the lab theory ? \nthe genome sequence of the outbreak virus indicates that its progenitor was either the horseshoe - bat coronavirus ratg13 , or a closely related wuhan institute of virology in 2013 from a horseshoe - bat colony in a mine in yunnan province , where miners had died from a SARS - like pneumonia in 2012 , was partly sequenced by WIV in 2013 - 2016 , was fully sequenced by WIV in 2018 - 2019 , and was published by WIV in 2020 . \nbat coronaviruses are present in nature in multiple parts of china . \ntherefore , the first human infection could have occurred as a natural accident , with a virus passing from a bat to a human , possibly through another animal . \nthe first entry of the SARS virus into the human population occurred as a natural accident in a rural part of guangdong province in 2002 . \nbut bat coronaviruses are also collected and studied by laboratories in multiple parts of china , including the wuhan institute of virology . \ntherefore , the first human infection also could have occurred as a laboratory accident , with a virus accidentally infecting a field collection staffer , a field survey staffer , or a laboratory staffer , followed by transmission from the staffer to the for this . \nthe second , third , fourth and fifth entries of the SARS virus into human populations occurred as a laboratory accident in singapore in 2003 , a laboratory accident in taipei in 2003 , and two separate laboratory accidents in beijing in 2004 . \nso for you there is still a fifty - fifty chance ? \nat this point in time , there is no secure basis to assign relative probabilities to the natural - accident hypothesis and the laboratory - accident hypothesis . \nnevertheless , there are three lines of circumstantial evidence that are worth in wuhan , a city of 11 million persons that does not contain horseshoe - bat colonies , that is tens of kilometers from , and that is outside the flight range of , the nearest known horseshoe - bat colonies . \nfurthermore , the outbreak occurred at a time of year when horseshoe bats are in hibernation and do not leave colonies second , the outbreak occurred in wuhan , on the doorstep of the laboratory that conducts the world \u2019 s largest research project on horseshoe bat viruses , that has the world \u2019 s that possessed and worked with the world \u2019 s closest sequenced relative of the outbreak virus . \nthe laboratory actively searched for new horseshoe - bat viruses in horseshoe - bat colonies in caves in remote rural areas in yunnan province , brought those new horseshoe - bat viruses to wuhan , and then mass - produced , genetically manipulated , and studied those new horseshoe - bat viruses , year - round , inside wuhan . \nA remarkable coincidence . \nthe last one ? \nthird , the bat - SARS - related - coronavirus projects at the wuhan institute of virology used personal protective equipment ( usually just gloves ; standards ( usually just biosafety level 2 ) that would pose very high risk of infection of field - collection , field - survey , or laboratory staff upon contact with a virus having the transmission properties of SARS - cov-2 . \nthe lab leak hypotheses , as raised in the open letter , should address four possible scenarios that do not imply genetic manipulation in a gain - of - function ( gof ) experiment . \nbut this chance can not be excluded . \ndr. ebright , when the pandemic started you declared : \u201c there \u2019 s absolutely nothing in the the virus was engineered \u201d . \nwould you reassert this today ? \nthe genome sequence of this virus shows no signatures of human manipulation . \nbut dr. ralph baric , who is considered the US leading expert in coronavirus , so he probably is the world one , says that is possible to engineer a virus in a lab without leaving a trace of the manipulation . \nthe fact that the genome sequence of this virus shows no signatures of human manipulation rules out the kinds of gain - of - function ( gof ) research that rule out kinds of gof research that do not leave signatures . \nthe chance that cov-2 is a gof virus does not imply that the leak could have occurred during a bioweapons program . \nopen letter signatories do not address this scenario , that you firmly exclude . \nbe that as it may , dr. ebright , as a longstanding opponent of biological weapons proliferation ( nature : jan. 24/02 & jan. 15/12 ) and founding member of the harvard \u201c cambridge working group consensus statement on the creation of potential pandemic pathogens current crisis demand a new debate and moratorium on these highly risky experiments , and this these time with a more international engagement ? \nwhat went wrong for the cambridge working group thesis during the 2014 - 2016 USA official moratorium and deliberative process on gain - of - function research of concern ( gofroc ) ? \nthe director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases ( NIAID ) and the director of the national institutes of health ( NIH ) have systematically thwarted efforts by the white house , the congress , scientists , and science concern and even to require risk - benefit review for projects involving gof research of concern . \nin 2014 , the obama white house implemented a \u201c pause \u201d in federal funding for gof research of concern . \nhowever , the document announcing the pause stated in a footnote that : \u201c an exception from pause may be obtained if head of funding agency determines research is urgently necessary to protect public health or national security \u201d . \nunfortunately , the NIAID director and the NIH director exploited this loophole to issue exemptions to projects exempted research was \u201c urgently necessary to protect public health or national security \u201d \u2013 thereby nullifying the pause . \nin 2017 , the trump administration announced a potential pandemic pathogens control and oversight ( P3CO ) framework that implemented a requirement for risk - benefit review of gof research of concern . \nhowever , the P3CO framework relies on the funding agency to flag and forward proposals for risk - benefit review . \nunfortunately , the NIAID director and the NIH director have declined to flag and forward proposals for risk - benefit review , thereby nullifying the with ppps have won all the debates of the last decade . \nbut I wonder why some of its most prestigious critics are keeping now such a low profile , when not a thunderous silence . \nand I am thinking of one of the leading organizers of the cambridge working group : the harvard epidemiologist dr. marc lipsitch , who in 2018 was still warning that influenza gof studies could provoke a pandemic on a scale never seen before . \nthe silence of some former leaders of the cambridge working group has been way , reading the cited dr. lipsitch paper that I came to know that perhaps the first experimental effort to create a PPP in a lab was the 2005 study titled : \u201c characterization of the reconstructed 1918 spanish influenza pandemic virus \u201d . \ndr. lipsitch wondered about it : \u201c whether it was wise to construct a virus that was historically associated with the worst pandemic in modern history \u201d . \ndo you remember this concrete gof study ? \nare you aware , fifteen years after , of any positive outcome of : was it wise to do it ? \nI consistently have stated that : \u201c this was research that should not have been performed \u201d ( NYT : oct. 05/05 & jan. 29/06 ) . \nand no , the work has not yielded information useful for preventing pandemics or responding to pandemics . \ndrs . \nimperiale and casadevall , both cambridge work group board members , echoed last summer : \u201c most experts who have been studying and discussing preparedness agree that the source of the pathogen does not significantly change the nature , dr. ebright , or maybe the outcome of knowing cov-2 origin could have saved lives ? \nunderstanding the origin of SARS - cov-2 is not crucial for responding to the present pandemic . \nbut it is crucial \u2013 absolutely crucial \u2013 for preventing future pandemics . \nregarding prevention , it was precisely dr. peter daszak , with a renewed granted from the NIH , now to target deadly viruses in south asia , who stated in august 2020 : \u201c we \u2019 re going to work in remote parts of malaysia and thailand to get to pandemic is going to start \u201d . \nnow , though dr. daszak is not openly cited in the march 4 open letter , he is clearly the WHO team member with a more biased vision and unresolved conflict of interest when it comes to inspecting a possible leak in the wuhan institute of virology . \nso going back : if the origin of covid-19 was a lab accident , gof , or in between , this would change the narrative of the whole pandemic , and so the measures that should be taken for instance , keeping crackpot scientists far away from deadly viruses . \nam I wrong ?

ask for $ 75,000 upfront ( which is 30 % ) . \nthen begin billing them on a monthly basis sixty days later for the remaining $ 175,000 ( so for the remaining 10 months it would be $ 17,500 a month

\nin december , I flagged concerns raised by dr. michael yeadon , former vice president and chief scientific officer at pfizer global , regarding two additives glycol and mneongreen . \nyeadon and his colleagues warned of potential fertility - specific risks involving antibodies against \u201c spike proteins \u201d that could disrupt the development of placenta in vaccinated women . \nit is \u201c unclear , \u201d they warned , \u201c what if any instructions / information \u201d that clinical trial subjects received regarding those risks . \nbear in mind that none of the clinical trials conducted by the vaccine - makers to win emergency use authorization from the federal government included pregnant women . \nthat has been historically true of drug trials because , as dr. doctors explained to me in an interview last week , the \u201c cascade of events that has to go one in the human body to get pregnant and maintain a pregnancy is incredibly complicated \u201d and \u201c we don \u2019 t know all the details of what we don \u2019 t know . \u201d \ngold called it \u201c shocking \u201d that medical professionals and pregnant women or women of childbearing age \u201c would be advocating \u201d taking \u201c anything experimental . \u201d [ \nWATCH FULL INTERVIEW HERE . ] \nyes , let \u2019 s be the COVID-19 vaccines . \nthey are wholly experimental treatments manufactured and marketed by multinational corporations that are immune from liability for their products being tested , approved and distributed at warp speed . \nan important white paper by america \u2019 s frontline doctors reminds citizens that COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by pfizer , moderna and astrazeneca are considered \u201c investigational \u201d in status and fall under legal standards for experimental medications . \nthe trials are ongoing and enrollees are tracked for at least the next two years . \u201c \nwe do not know the be pregnant , \u201d gold and her colleagues report . \u201c \nthere is no actual data at all for an enormous percentage of the population , probably more than half . \u201d \non top of all that uncertainty and lack of data , the \u201c mechanism of action of the experimental mrna vaccines includes a possible auto - immune rejection of the placenta . \nin layman \u2019 s terms , the vaccine may permanently interfere with a woman \u2019 s ability to maintain a pregnancy . \u201d \nin fact , as the labeling on COVID-19 vaccine vials t is unknown whether COVID-19 mrna vaccinebnt162b2 has an impact on fertility . \nand women of childbearing age are advised to avoid pregnancy for at least two months after their second dose . \u201d \nnevertheless , dr. anthony fauci is now downplaying the risks of COVID-19 jab complications in pregnant women and claims there are \u201c no red flags , \u201d while the world health organization has warned that \u201c very little data are available to assess vaccine safety in pregnancy . \u201d \nlet me give you the bottom line on the \u201c expert \u201d safe for pregnant women : they just don \u2019 t know . \nyet , those who dare dissent from big pharma orthodoxy have been branded \u201c conspiracy theorists \u201d and are being pushed off social media . \nmerely noting that the experts don \u2019 t know what they don \u2019 t know is smeared as \u201c misinformation \u201d or \u201c disinformation . \u201d ( \nyou may remember I first warned you about this global censorship of vaccine dissidents in march 2019 . ) \nthe national vaccine information center \u2019 s VAERS database tracker has reported miscarriages , fetal death , premature delivery or stillbirth . \nthe background miscarriage rate is about 10 - 15 % , so you would expect some miscarriages to happen regardless of the vaccine . \nbut extreme caution is still advised . \nalex berenson , former new york times reporter and COVID-19 watchdog , asks : \u201c where \u2019 s the safety data ? \u201d \nhe reports that animal studies on COVID jabs have shown \u201c much higher rates of lost fetuses \u201d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and to date , the only such trials have been conducted , federal vaccine adverse event reporting system data on human COVID-19 vaccine recipients have disclosed \u201c multiple cases of apparently healthy late - term fetuses lost days after vaccinations , \u201d berenson adds . \u201c \nhealthy pregnant women are at next to no risk from # covid ; why on earth would anyone try to shame them into getting this vaccine ?
