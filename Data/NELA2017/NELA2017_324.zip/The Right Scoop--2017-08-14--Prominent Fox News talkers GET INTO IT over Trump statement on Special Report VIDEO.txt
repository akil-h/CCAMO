Mollie Hemingway and Stephen Hayes do not see eye to eye on Trump’s Saturday statement at all and they got into it a bit on Special Report.

Let me set the scene.

Mollie steps in to respond with this – watch to the end because that’s when the action happens:

I think in 2020 I might just vote for Hillary just to unify the Republican Party again, because I’m honestly sick of this.
