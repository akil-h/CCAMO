IN the latest outrage from the LGBT community, they’re freaking out over Dave Chappelle’s comedy sketches. Glenn Beck aired one of the funnier ones and it’s really worth listening to.

I’m sorry, but that’s just funny. Unfortunately, gays and others did NOT find it so, and they’re calling it homophobic. Because nobody has a sense of humor anymore.

I really think the principle of offense here should be whether there is a malicious intent, and clearly Chappelle isn’t trying to rip on gay people, he’s just making fun of particular gay people he knows. Oh well…
