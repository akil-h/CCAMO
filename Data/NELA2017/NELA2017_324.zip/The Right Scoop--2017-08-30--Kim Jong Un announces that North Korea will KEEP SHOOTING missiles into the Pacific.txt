The Associated Press reports that North Korean dictator totalitarian scumbag Kim Jong Un will continue shooting his rockets into the Pacific ocean.

North Korea’s state media says leader Kim Jong Un has called for more ballistic missile launches into the Pacific a day after it flew a missile designed to carry a nuclear payload over Japan. The Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim expressed great satisfaction with the launch, calling it a “meaningful prelude” to containing Guam, the U.S. Pacific territory and military hub. The agency says Kim said the country needs to conduct more ballistic missile tests to the Pacific to advance the capabilities of its strategic force. The agency says the missile the North fired Tuesday was the Hwasong-12 intermediate range missile it recently threatened to fire toward Guam.

This is sure to keep raising tensions in the region and it’s meant to provoke Trump. With his revamped staff, however, he may not go off on his Twitter making emotional statements and threats. But are we going to do anything about North Korea’s escalating threats?

He’s already said they will face “fire and fury” if they continue to threaten us. Well that’s what they’re doing…so..?
