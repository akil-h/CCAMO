El Presidente Trumpo told the press he was really disappointed in Republicans not passing the Senate bill, but that he was going to let Obamacare fail.

With the media the way it is, you know they’re gonna pin any Obamacare failure on Trump too. So people will DIE if we repeal Obamacare, but also we’ll be blamed because we didn’t repeal it and let it fail.

Still, it really comes down to the Republican failure. I have some sympathy here because the American public seems to want everything without paying it for it, but that’s no excuse. Republicans have said for decades they know how to “fix” health care. Then DO IT. This is your ONE DAMN JOB. Their job is, literally, to sit on their Obamas, debate, and come up with solutions to government problems. And they have failed miserably.

I’m not letting Trump off the hook here – he literally told people he had a plan and it was gonna be beautiful. He lied to the American people too. But they seem to love that, so why wouldn’t he? In the case of the Republicans, I just don’t see ANY excuse whatsoever for their failure here, other than that they’re really crappy at their jobs, and they don’t have the spines to actually put in place what they’ve been saying are solutions to our problems.
