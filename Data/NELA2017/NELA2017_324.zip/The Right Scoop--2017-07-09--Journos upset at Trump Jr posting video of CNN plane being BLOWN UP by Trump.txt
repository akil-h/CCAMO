The president’s son Trump Jr. shows that they’re not going to let up not even a little bit on the media. He posted this video with a scene from Top Gun (apparently?) of Trump destroying a plane with the CNN logo superimposed on it.

One of he best I've seen. 😂😂😂 #Repost @oldrowofficial ・・・ Hey @cnn we heard you like memes 😎👌🏻🐜🌶🔥 s p i c y b o i

I dunno guys, you lose the moral ground about rhetoric on the left when you’re spreading this kind of crap, but who cares, right? The 35% of the American public that loves this kind of stuff is all Trump needs – that’s why he’s been able to pass so much legislation, yes? The *overwhelming* support from the public on stuff like this has *forced* even Democrats to vote for the border wall currently under construction, and the very popular Obamacare replace and repeal, and the overwhelmingly popular tax bill that we’ve all read because it was put out the day he was elected.

That’s why they can waste their time on this kind of stuff, because there’s just been so much winning.

Even Trump Jr. wasn’t as bad as Gateway Pundit’s scummy correspondent, who posted this 9/11 meme:

So, Trump is so awesome, he’s like the 9/11 hijackers murdering nearly 3,000 Americans, who are… like.. CNN.

Truly these meme-masters are the best and brightest among us.
