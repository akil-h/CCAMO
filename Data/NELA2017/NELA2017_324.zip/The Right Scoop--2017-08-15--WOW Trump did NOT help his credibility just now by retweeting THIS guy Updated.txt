Oh man. I cannot believe… why would.. on this day of all days. I’m just.. wow.

OK this is what happened.

Now for those who don’t know, Jack Posobiec is an alt-right activist.

He’s the dunce that was screaming, “you’re all a bunch of Goebbels!” at the audience watching Shakespeare in the Park when Lauren Loony “saved Trump’s life” from Never Trumpers by disrupting the performance. And he likes Western Civilization so much and wants to save it from barbarians, even though he doesn’t know how to spell Julius Caesar.

And Trump just retweeted him, out of the millions and millions of followers he has, tonight, on the day that he was trying to convince people he’s not a racist.

There’s some debate as to whether the label “alt-right” really fits Jack Posobiec. Having read much of his activism, I think it fits. I mean, not many political activists take grinning happy pics with white nationalist and kinda racist Richard Spencer:

But that will be the debate tomorrow. And whatever side you fall on, no one can deny that this does absolutely NOTHING to help advance Trump’s actual agenda.
