Rick Santorum offers his typically populist defense of Trump on CNN – the voters wanted it, so you have no right to criticize it anymore.

I hear this a lot out of the more extremist proto-fascist Trump cultists (not all supporters are this bad), and it really is one of the stupidest defenses of Trump. Yeah, he won the election, he’s the president. Does that mean we’re not allowed to criticize anymore? I wasn’t aware that the First Amendment is null and void if a president wins an election.

Did all these proto-fascists follow this sacred rule when Obama was elected? No, of course not. It’s utterly idiotic to suggest no one can criticize a president because the people elected him. But when you can’t defend the actions of a president, and you’ve been habituated into petty partisan tribalism, that’s the best you can muster.
