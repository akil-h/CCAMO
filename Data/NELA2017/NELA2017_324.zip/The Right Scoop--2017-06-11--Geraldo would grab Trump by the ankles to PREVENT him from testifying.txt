Geraldo says that it would be a terrrrrible idea for el Trumpo to testify just for the sake of making Comey into a liar. In fact, he says that if he were Trump’s lawyer, he would grab him by the ankles to keep him from testifying!

While Geraldo is a weirdo, he’s sooper right about this one. It was absolutely insane of Trump to volunteer to say so under oath, and the Democrats are already calling his bluff. Who knows what would happen if they got Trump under oath and he started doing his “truthful hyperbole” bit. In fact, nearly every Trump supporter has said it would be a terrible idea. So let’s do it!!!!
