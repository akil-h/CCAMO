This is kinda surprising. Judge Napolitano says that Hillary Clinton has a “legitimate argument” that Comey interfered with the election.

Napolitano has been one of the most vehement Trump supporters, but I guess he’s reasonable to admit when Trump’s opponent has some rational argument. Even Democrats are mocking and bashing Hillary for trying to put the blame on something other than herself. I dunno, both can be true, logically speaking.
