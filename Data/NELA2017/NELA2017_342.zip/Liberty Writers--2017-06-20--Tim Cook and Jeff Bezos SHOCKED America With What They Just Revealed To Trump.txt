Tim Cook, Eric Schmidt, Jeff Bezos SHOCKED America With What They Just Declared About Trump

Some of the top technology companies in America met with Trump at the White House. They praised him afterward. Now, you won’t see this on the mainstream media. You won’t’ see anything of worth on the mainstream media. Here are Trump’s inspiring remarks at the beginning of the conference.

1. Eric Schmidt, CEO Of Google: “I’m absolutely convinced that during your administration there is going to be a huge explosion of new opportunities because of the platforms that are getting built in our industry,” Schmidt said to Trump after the meeting, as over a dozen CEOs went around the table to make comments after the meeting.

Here is what Tim Cook said.

2. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple: “The U.S. should have the most modern government in the world, and today it doesn’t,” he said.

Now that’s great. Cook then said, “The government should be focused on its citizens, and the services of the government should be measured on how pleased the citizens are with receiving its services.”

3. Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon: “I think it would be impossible to overstate this, is that the United States needs to — in every way at every level — be working on machine learning and artificial intelligence,” he said. “That can be used in every part of government to improve the services that government provides to citizens.”

You see that? Trump has the tech giants helping him out. They have been fighting him from day one. Now, he has them praising his moves. (h/t Breitbart)
