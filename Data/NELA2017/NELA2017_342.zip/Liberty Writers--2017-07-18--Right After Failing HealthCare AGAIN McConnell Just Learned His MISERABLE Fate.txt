Remember when Donald Trump promised last year that he was gonna “Drain the Swamp”? Yeah, well, turns out that list includes quite a few of the “old guard” Republicans.

Today the swamp just got a bit thinner when leading Republican Senator Ron Johnson made the party’s feelings about Leader Mitch McConnell VERY clear…

In the words of Senator Johnson, McConnell’s CONTINUOUS failure on HealthCare is a “breach of trust” of his colleagues.

When asked if he still has faith in McConnell’s leadership, Johnson told NBC News:

“This was the Senate’s responsibility. I tried to encourage my colleagues in leadership to follow that process but we followed a political process and it hasn’t been particularly successful.”

He is right. McConnell has failed multiple times now after YEARS of talking about Repealing ObamaCare. I guess that old dog was all bark, no bite.

So, it looks like Mitch McConnell’s time as the Top Senate Republican is coming to an end. Who should they appoint NEXT to lead the party and actually get stuff done.

We are the party who abolished slavery and built our great Navy, what the Senate is doing right now is an EMBARRASSMENT to all Republicans.
