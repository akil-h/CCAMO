Maxine Waters obviously isn’t paying attention at all, and she just revealed how ignorant she really is!

She was interviewed on July 8 on MSNBC, as a part of their really “credible” programming called Moment of Maxine, and just straight up continued to spread fake news!

And this wasn’t just any fake news!  No, this was fake news that has been completely disproved!  Here’s what she said (the proven fake part is right at 2:18):

Now, I just reported on this yesterday.  The fake news outlets spread a complete lie when many of them reported  that all 17 intelligence agencies agreed that Russia interfered with the 2016 election.  Here’s the clip again, of the flames of fake news being fanned by the MSM:

Trump investigated this allegation and proved that it was 4, not 17 (big difference, right?).  And the New York Times admitted Trump was correct!  Of course, they had to spin their admission in a way to keep trying to discredit the President, but what else would we expect?

Maxine Waters has NO credibility at all, ya’ll!  I mean, if she’s ignorant in that respect, how can anyone believe anything that comes out of her mouth?!  I mean, geez, Congresswoman!  If you’re going to open your mouth as much as you do, at least know what you’re talking about!  But clearly, she does not and clearly she doesn’t care if she gets her facts right or not!

If you’re as tired of hearing her yap as I am, please get this SHARED everywhere, so everyone can see that she can’t be trusted!
