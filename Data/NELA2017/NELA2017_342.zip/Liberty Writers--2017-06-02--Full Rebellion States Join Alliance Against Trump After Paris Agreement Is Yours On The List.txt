It appears that now states are revolting against President Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement.

3 states have already joined together now in opposition of President Trump’s decision to save the country trillions of dollars.

Those states include New York, Washington, and of course California and are calling themselves the United States Climate Alliance.

Washington state governor Jay Inslee had a lot to say about his distaste of saving the country that wasn’t asked by Obama in the first place if they wanted to join the Paris Climate Agreement.

Inslee claims in his statement “the inaction in D.C. is met by an equal force of action from the states.”

Is he referring to the last 8 years and our economy because President Trump is taking action in taking down the deficit that Obama created while sitting idly by and watching the world  turn.

The American people were never asked if they wanted to join the Paris agreement and if these states want to bankrupt themselves, they won’t receive any funding from the White House when they run out.

Trump promised the American people that he would pull out of the agreement and he followed through on yet another promise.

President Trump had strong words during his announcement to pull out of the climate agreement where he said that he was elected to protect the people of Pittsburgh no Paris and that is exactly what he chose to do.

Rather than bankrupt our economy that was soaring to record highs as he made the announcement, he chose to put the welfare of the American people first rather than risk destroying the economy again with more debt.

It will take our country years to pay off the debt of Obama and that is what President Trump has put first above all else.
