President Trump, ripping Democrats as "absolutely obstructionists," appears to be prepared to give up his new push to repeal and replace Obamacare, suggesting that a new target could be in September.

"Will it be this week or next week, I don't know," he told reporters at a reception Monday afternoon in the Roosevelt Room.

"We could come back in September, but we'll see what we get now," he added of the negotiations with Democrats.

His comments about delaying his budget agenda were focused on healthcare, and not the border wall, though the administration has tied both to his budget demands going into this week.

They came at the top of a 25 minute Q&A with conservative journalists and followed a question about the administration's frustration with Congress.

"I think we are going to be very successful with our healthcare bill. I think it's going to be great," said the president who has been making a second push on healthcare.

"I think we have the votes. We're going to be very close to having the votes. But again, we're going to get zero Democrat votes ... zero from the other side," he said. "They're obstructionists. And it's too bad but they are absolutely obstructionists."

He added, "Despite that, I think we are going to have a great bill very shortly," before suggesting that it could wait until September for action.

He opened the session promoting his first 100 days in office, including the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, then said, "If you have any questions, let's go."
