South Carolina Representative and patriot Trey Gowdy stated Monday that he told Attorney General Jeff Sessions over the weekend that he is not the best person to take over as FBI director.

Trey Gowdy, who many considered to be the top contender to replace the fired Jim Comey, said that he met with AG Jeff Sessions on Saturday and even had a meeting him a second time Monday to discuss the open position.

Howdy firmly believes that he isn’t the correct person to run the FBI. He knows what is required, but he doesn’t believe he has what he wants to see in an FBI Director.

The meetings were also allegedly attended by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

James Comey was abruptly fired by President Trump last week and it caused a severe backlash.

In addition to Gowdy, Trump and Sessions are want to nominate another Republican politician for the FBI position. Senator John Cornyn, from Texas, has been bounced around as a possible replacement for Jim Comey.

A partisan pick like Gowdy or Cornyn would have severe issues in passing Senate confirmation given the alleged circumstances surrounding Comey’s firing. The Obama appointee was leading the investigation into potential Russian tampering in the presidential election.

The best part of this is the class that Gowdy showed in his “bowing out” of consideration for the position.

The Trump Administration has a lot of people to consider. Not to mention all of the qualifications and all of the backlashes they will face with each nomination.

It can be too partisan for each party and too nonpartisan which seems like the guy can’t make up his mind.

Trey Gowdy should be involved in the process because he has very good character and he knows exactly how to serve his constituency and his nation just the way he should.
