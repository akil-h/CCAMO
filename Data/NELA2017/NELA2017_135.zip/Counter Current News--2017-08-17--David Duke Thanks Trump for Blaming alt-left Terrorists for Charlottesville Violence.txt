After Trump refused to directly blame the white supremacists for the violence and terrorism they were responsible for in Charlottesville, he got a nice thank you for his support from a famous white supremacist leader.

White nationalist leader David Duke thanked President Trump for his honesty and courage in blaming the violence in Charlottesville, Va., on the “alt-left.”



 Trump believes the ones standing up to the Nazis and their hatred are responsible.

At a press conference Tuesday, Trump doubled down on his claim that “both sides” were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, reported The Hill.

“What about the alt-left that came charging at the — as you say, the alt-right?” Trump said.

“Do they have any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do,” he continued. “As far as I am concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day.”

Apparently Trump thinks people need a permit to stand up to hatred and violence, because he accused left-wing anti-fascist or “antifa” protesters of showing up “without a permit,” and said they were “very, very violent.”

“And nobody wants to say that. But I’ll say it right now,” Trump told reporters. “You had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit, and they were very, very violent.”

 



Duke also attended the Charlottesville rally where he reiterated his support for Trump.

“We’re going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump, and that’s what we believed in, that’s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take our country back and that’s what we gotta do,” Duke told reporters on Saturday.
