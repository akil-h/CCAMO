Everyone wonders what America’s busiest multi-tasking Washington couple, Ivanka and Jared Kushner, is like at home. Well, I happened to get my hands on a transcript — okay, I wiretapped their duvet and beat Obama to it!

Do I have to?

Let the nanny do it.

She has one job!

Pfft.  She should watch a professional — I can walk, chew gum and glare at Bannon at the same time!

Aren’t these your socks on the floor?

I drop — let the elves do the rest.

How about that ring around the tub?

If I’m not mistaken — isn’t that our ring?

Yes, sweetcakes, but who’s gonna clean it?

It’s all in the pre-nup.

Why have a pre-nup — you’re my everything.

No, I’m your father’s everything!

But, I have one complaint.  After sex…why do you always say, “Done and done”?

Do I?  How rude.  I guess I was thinking of my Israeli Peace Agreement, my speech at the unveiling of Trump’s face on Mt. Rushmore and my stand-up routine at the White House Correspondent’s Dinner!

Well, I will be.  Comic, Yakov Smirnoff & I are going to trade — he wants to lay low in our basement & I get his joke: “At the grocery store — powdered milk, powdered eggs, baby powder — what a country”!

You know Russians too?

How do you keep so many balls in the air?

Keep your eye on the prize.

Is that when you’ll take out the trash?

Okay, we hold the dems off for 4 years with smoke screens & retire to…

Where you wanna go, Goldilocks?

He won’t need you anymore — let Tiffany have a shot.

Really — how many times has he changed his Will?

Let’s see now — the poison dart.  The bear trap.  The brake-less Mazeratti…20?
