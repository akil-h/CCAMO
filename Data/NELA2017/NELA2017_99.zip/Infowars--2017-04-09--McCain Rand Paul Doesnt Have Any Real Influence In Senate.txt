Referring to Rand Paul, McCain told Wolf Blitzer, “He doesn’t have any real influence in the United States Senate.”

McCain also said, “I don’t pay any attention to what Senator Paul says.”

This comes as Paul has been a critic of President Trump’s ordered strike on Syria without Congressional approval. Paul called the move “illegal” and “unconstitutional.”

McCain supported the strikes and supports further action in Syria as well, saying that the airstrikes were a “beginning.”
