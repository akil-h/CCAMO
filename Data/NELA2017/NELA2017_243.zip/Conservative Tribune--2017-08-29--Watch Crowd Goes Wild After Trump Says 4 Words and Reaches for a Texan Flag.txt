Texas is Donald Trump country — at least if the state’s enthusiastic response to the president’s arrival on Tuesday is any indication.

Both the president and the first lady arrived in storm-ravaged Corpus Christi to meet with first responders dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.

While on the way to the Annaville Fire Department for a briefing on the area’s rescue efforts, hundreds of Texans reportedly lined the roads to welcome and cheer for Trump.

Chants of “USA!,” “Texas for Trump,” “Texas Strong,” and “We Love Trump!” could all be heard as Trump arrived, according to Breitbart News. A photo of the crowd showed Texans lined up so far down the road that they filled the entire picture.

President Trump took a moment to address the gathered people. Climbing onto a ladder and waving the Texas state flag, Trump and said four words that made the crowd go wild.

Trump has made a strong effort to stay in the loop about the hurricane preparations and response efforts. On Twitter, he posted numerous updates as he and the first lady monitored the storm from Camp David, and made it clear that he intended to visit the affected areas as soon as possible.

The president was reportedly also in close contact with Texas officials, including Governor Abbott, former Governor Rick Perry and Senator Ted Cruz.

“[The president] told me directly whatever Texas needs, you got it,” Cruz stated to CNBC’s Contessa Brewer, who is on location in Houston.

It would have been easy for the president to fire off a few concerned tweets, say a few words on camera, and then do nothing to actually help Texas.

Instead, Trump showed real leadership by flying to the disaster area in person. As the videos and photos of the crowd show, his arrival was a great morale boost to residents and emergency workers… and that is something that Texas desperately needed.
