President Trump made the nation collectively slam our heads into the wall this afternoon when he remarked that “Harvey. It sounds like such an innocent name, but isn’t.”

Speaking to his cabinet, the media, and a group of people whose lives have been upturned by the historic devastation of Hurricane Harvey, the President’s words were astonishing to hear.

World-famous author J.K. Rowling fired off a snarky response that sums up just how desperate a situation we’ve found ourselves in with this man who we somehow elected to lead us:

Trump cannot seem to shake the awe he feels at seeing the power of Hurricane Harvey, and it’s clear why. As the pampered scion of New York patricians who was born with a silver thumb in his mouth, Trump has lived a sheltered and privileged life, never having to see the suffering of the common people up close and personal.

Now that he’s gotten a taste of how powerful the wrath of the climate can be, he is incapable of responding appropriately – never a good sign for the so-called leader of the so-called free world.

Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!
