Left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore is continuing to beat his very public drum against Republican President Donald Trump — and this time he’s up in arms over Trump’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which delays deportations for young illegal immigrants.

On Monday, Moore posted the following to Facebook: “Our voices must be loud tomorrow should Trump do what they say he’s going to do. He’s shameless and without a conscience. My heart goes out to all who fear him tonight. We will find a way to protect you.”

Moore then posted on Twitter following Trump’s DACA decision Tuesday, calling for action:

But the social media message from Moore that struck the biggest nerve was his Facebook post Tuesday — and it was, of all things, a quotation attributed to iconic non-violence advocate Mohandas Gandhi.

It read: “Remember that all through history, there have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they seem invincible. But in the end, they always fall…Always.”

Moore’s post has received 25,000 “likes” along with other reactions as of Thursday morning — and many commenters latched on to Moore’s apparent characterization of Trump as a tyrant and murderer and relished how he might “fall.”

While the vast majority of commenters supported Moore’s post, there were a few detractors.
