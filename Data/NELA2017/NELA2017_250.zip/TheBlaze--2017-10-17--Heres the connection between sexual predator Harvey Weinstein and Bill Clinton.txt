Hollywood is finally distancing itself from sexual predator Harvey Weinstein, but recently unearthed is a significant connection between him and former President Bill Clinton, who was also accused of numerous sexual assaults.

What is the connection?

Fox News reports on a news item from 1998 in the Washington Post where a list of contributors to Bill Clinton’s legal defense fund is listed.

Amidst some famous names is the now infamous name, Harvey Weinstein.

“Hollywood was quick to come to the president’s aid,” the decades old report read. “Among the 62 donors giving the maximum $10,000 were performers and directors such as Tom Hanks, Barbra Streisand, Michael Douglas, Ron Howard, Norman Lear, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw-Spielberg as well as studio executives Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen, Harvey Weinstein and Bud Yorkin.”

Clinton was defending himself in an investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Star looking into whether the president had committed perjury or obstruction of justice in a civil lawsuit over claims of sexual harassment.

Few will miss the coincidence of Bill Clinton being financially aided in his legal defense having to do with sexual harassment, by a studio executive who was later discovered to have allegedly committed multiple acts of sexual harassment and assault himself.

The Clintons have indicated that they will not be returning donations made from Harvey Weinstein to their Clinton foundation.
