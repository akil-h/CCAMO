President Trump and CNN’s Jim Acosta traded barbs Monday when the reporter pressed Trump to take questions about his response to the weekend white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va.

Trump made a statement earlier today said that “racism is evil” and specifically criticized the KKK, Nazis and other groups that organized the rally for the first time. But he did not take questions from reporters, despite later calling it a "press conference."

At a second announcement later in the day, Trump said he is launching an investigation into China’s trade practices.

As that announcement ended, Acosta asked Trump if reporters could ask him questions about his remarks on Charlottesville.

“It doesn’t bother me at all, but I like real news, not fake news,” Trump said, pointing at Acosta. “You’re fake news.”

“Haven’t you spread a lot of fake news yourself, sir?” Acosta shot back.

Trump ignored the question and exited the room.

Acosta also criticized Trump for calling his remarks on Charlottesville a press conference on Twitter.

“The president said we just had a press conference. We did not. That's fake news,” Acosta said.
