The sports brand Reebok is mocking President Trump’s compliments of French President Emmanuel Macron’s wife that were made during Trump's visit to France last week.

The sports apparel company posted a graphic to their Twitter account on Friday.

In a chart, labeled “when is it appropriate to say, ‘You’re in such good shape…beautiful,’” several scenarios are listed, including “Are you a world leader greeting the spouse of a head of state?” and “Are you in an elevator with a woman?" In response, the company advises: “No.”

“Did you just find a forgotten action figure from your youth, unscathed after decades, in your parents’ basement?” is the only scenario on the chart that is labeled as appropriate for Trump’s quote.

Video posted to Macron’s Facebook page Thursday caught Trump complimenting France's first lady Brigitte Macron as the two world leaders and their wives greeted each other following a tour.

"You know, you're in such good shape," Trump said to Brigitte Macron, and then repeated the same to Emmanuel Macron. "Beautiful.”

Trump’s recent visit to France honoring Bastille Day included plenty of face time with Macron, including a lavish dinner inside the Eiffel Tower.
