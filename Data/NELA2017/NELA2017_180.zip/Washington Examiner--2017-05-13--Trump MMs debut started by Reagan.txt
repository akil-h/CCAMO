It's official: Donald Trump really is the president.

The proof: boxes of presidential M&Ms with his signature were handed out for the first time Saturday to those on Air Force One.

The Examiner's Al Weaver was the pool reporter for the president's trip to Lynchburg, Va., and he wrote: "M&M boxes were handed out featuring POTUS's signature for what some poolers believe is the first time."

Up until today, blank boxes of M&Ms and Hershey's Kisses were only available as the newer boxes were being printed. During a recent gathering with other reporters in the Roosevelt Room with Trump, Secrets grabbed a couple.

The M&Ms have a rich history dating back to former President Ronald Reagan who requested them as a replacement to free cigarettes.

Every president since has had their signature on the specially-made boxes and they are a must have for every visitor to the White House or Air Force One passenger.
