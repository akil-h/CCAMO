The super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan is spending another $500,000 in Montana to help the GOP protect an open House seat in May 25 special election.

The outlay brings Congressional Leadership Fund's total spending in the Montana special to $2 million, the group told the Washington Examiner. This latest cash infusion will go toward direct mail advertising and field operations. The super PAC is financing close to 50 field personnel to knock on doors, with the goal of greeting 75,000 households by Election Day.

Democrat Rob Quist, a liberal folk singer, is running against businessman and failed 2016 gubernatorial candidate Greg Gianforte for the seat vacated by Republican Ryan Zinke. Zinke retired after winning re-election last year and becoming President Trump's Interior secretary.

Congressional Leadership Fund is spending more than $1 million on television advertising in Montana, taking no chances in the GOP-leaning state after close calls versus underdog Democrats in special House elections in Kansas and Georgia. Democrats, energized by opposition to Trump, have seen a surge in activism, turnout and fundraising.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee this week upped its investment in the Montana race to $600,000, with a $400,000 television buy, Huffington Post reported.
