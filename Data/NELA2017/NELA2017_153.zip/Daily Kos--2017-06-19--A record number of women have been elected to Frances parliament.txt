American women’s interest in running for office has taken off after Trump’s election. France, however, is a bit ahead of us in terms of putting women into elected office. According to Reuters, today’s election results brings great news for folks concerned about gender representation in government with their record-breaking number of women elected to France’s National Assembly.

Of the 577 newly elected lawmakers, 223 were female, beating the previous record of 155 set after the last election. That sent France leapfrogging from 64th to 17th in the world rankings of female parliamentary representation and to 6th place in Europe, overtaking Britain and Germany, according to Inter-parliamentary Union data compiled at the start of June.

The country has made great strides in a short amount of time: in 2002, only 12.3% of the National Assembly was female. Now it’s at 38.6%. Compare this to our own national stats: only 83 women are in the House of Representatives (19.1%) and the stats aren’t much better for our Senate—only 21% are women.
