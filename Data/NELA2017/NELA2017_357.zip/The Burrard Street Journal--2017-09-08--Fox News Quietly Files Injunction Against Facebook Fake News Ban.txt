NEW YORK, NY—One of America’s largest news organizations, FOX News, has this morning quietly filed an injunction against Facebook, claiming they are being “unfairly” labelled as fake news.

The highly respected media outlet made the move 6 months after Facebook announced plans to limit the spread of fake news across its platform leaving executives at FOX “very worried” according to internal sources.

Attorneys for the News Corp. owned tv channel claim their client has been unfairly targeted by Facebook with stories such as “Obama Favourite To Become Next President Of Kenya” failing to take off as they had prior to the 2016 election.

“The actions of Facebook are reprehensible and incredibly damaging to free speech and our client’s ability to report on news in the manner they see fit, free from logic or facts,” attorney Giles Barnes told CNBC. “Legal action is the only path remaining.”

FOX further alleged that the recent turmoil following the Bill O’Reilly and Roger Ailes scandals, was as a result of Facebook unfairly allowing other news stations to report on them.

The shocking development forced the President of the United States to tweet his support for the right-wing news agency, an unprecedented move. He confirmed that FOX News is “100% fact” unlike the more obvious fake news sites like CNN, The NY Times and Healthcare.gov.

In unrelated news FOX has purchased the rights to an upcoming sequel to The Social Network, and are expected to produce, write and star in the movie.
