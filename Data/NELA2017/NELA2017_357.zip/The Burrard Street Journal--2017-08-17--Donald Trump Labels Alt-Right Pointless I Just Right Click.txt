WASHINGTON, DC—American President Donald Trump has released his fourth official statement on the highly controversial alt-right labelling the group “totally pointless” in a new interview with the National Enquirer.

“I just wanted to make sure I researched this really thoroughly,” the President explained for constantly changing his stance on the white supremacist linked-group. “Now I finally know exactly what I’m talking about, I can confirm that I, Donald J. Trump do not believe in alt-right, alt-left, whatever… I just right click instead.”

“It’s much easier and quicker so honestly it’s a no brainer. I really cannot understand why people are creating such a fuss over all this,” he added.

“For instance, let’s say when you’re using Microsoft Paint to create your art, which you love to do, and you just want to change the colour of the swastika you’re drawing…don’t alt-right! Just right click and change colour. It’s really that simple.”

“Or say you wanted to copy and paste a line of text straight out of somewhere like FOX News, Breitbart, KKK Today, wherever… don’t worry about alt-right! Just right click, hit copy, go to your twitter timeline, click paste, and you’re done. See? It’s as easy as being President of the United States.”
