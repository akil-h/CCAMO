Film critics have praised new action drama Fast & Furious 8, with some saying it is the franchise’s best instalment in months.

“If I had to put together a list of the top F&F films of 2017, this would be right on top,” said one critic, adding, “but of course it’s only April”.

Another critic put his reputation on the line claiming, “There won’t be a better Furious movie this side of the northern summer. Period. It’s that good”.

Fast & Furious fan Tom Brison said, “Action star Vin Diesel plays street racer Dominic Toretto as his crew goes head to head with villains – and the law. That’s the plot for the other films. I can’t wait to see what’s in store in number 8”.

The film races into cinemas this month.
