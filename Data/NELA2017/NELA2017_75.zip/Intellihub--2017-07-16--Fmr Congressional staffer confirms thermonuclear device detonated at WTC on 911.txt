(INTELLIHUB) — Former U.S. Congressional staffer Susan Lindauer said that she was told by a trusted contact of hers in the intelligence community that three suspicious white vans arrived at the World Trade Center just days before the Sept. 11 attack.

The vans were likely from the Office of Secure Transport (OST) which is managed by the U. S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration and is responsible for the safe and secure transport of nuclear munitions.

“I have been told by somebody who saw the videos that at the World Trade Center from approximately August 23 […] until approximately September 3 [that] strange vans, and there were just maybe three, […] janitorial vans, arrived at three in the morning,” the former Congressional staffer said. “Between the hours of three o’clock and five o’clock, these vans had never been in this building before. It was an anomaly […] they showed up for ten or eleven days, approximately, then they were never seen again.”

But more importantly, Lindauer admits that her CIA handler Richard Fuisz told her not to return to New York City in September of 2001 and that it would be ‘far too dangerous’ to do so due to the fact that the ‘imminent’ detonation of a miniature thermonuclear device’ was expected.
