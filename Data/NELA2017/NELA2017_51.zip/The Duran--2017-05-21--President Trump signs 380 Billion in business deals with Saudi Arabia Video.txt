Donald Trump marks his first visit overseas as US President with a historic stop to Saudi Arabia, signing $380 billion in business deals and a whopping $110 billion in military sales.

Trump is the first American president to make Saudi Arabia, or any Muslim-majority country, his inaugural stop overseas.

Expect Saudi Arabia to ramp up its propagation of the Wahhabi terrorist ideology, continue to flood Syria with jihadist – ISIS fighters, and escalate its bombing of Yemen.

The liberal left, mainstream media is silent on Trump’s deal with the Saudi Arabian dictatorship that suppresses woman’s rights and kills gays.
