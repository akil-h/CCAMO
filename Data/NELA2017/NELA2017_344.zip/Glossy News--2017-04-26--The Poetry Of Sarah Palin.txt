I shot an arrow

 Into the air

 It came down

 And pegged a hare.

 My rifle I shot so straight and true

 And brought me down a caribou.

 Moose when they see my trail they quake

 Ptarmigan their feathers shake.

 Full grown bears will turn and run

 When they see my Remington.

The creatures know

 I’m somewhat prone

 To leave them dead,

 Their brains out-blown.

To run, now some will not even bother,

 They stand stock still, scared to the bone,

 It’s because I’m the biggest Mother,

 That their woods have ever known.

Mirror, mirror on the wall,

 Who’s the grandest of us all?

 I’ve seduced McCain, become his Queen

 And before the world am now seen.

 My realm has grown from Alaska land

 To encompass Maine to Rio Grande.

 I’m so hot Ted Nugent wants to do me

 And yet the Democrats eschew me.

 I’m so hot the firemen douse me

 When old men try to accost me.

I know now it’s all a game,

 A strive for glory, power and fame.

 Shake all hands and smile a lot,

 Make sure chickens are in every pot.

 But I will play a little dumb

 And wait for my chance to come

 And go hell bent for broke

 Should ever the old geezer croak.

On me you must have pity,

 I am not from the big city.

 Sophistication is an art

 I have not yet gart.

 I’ve never had Chablis,

 Modern art still eludes me.

 But don’t you get rude,

 Or even a little bit crude

 Or I will show you some talent

 From my side of the planet,

 You’ll be field-dressed and gutted

 And as a last touch- denutted.

 Said a young lass from Alaska

 “If I want yer opinion I’ll ask ‘ya!”

 A maverick she was

 With justifiable cause

 Her very own party

 Had treated her farty

 So she said, “If ‘ya screw me then I’ll blast ‘ya!”
