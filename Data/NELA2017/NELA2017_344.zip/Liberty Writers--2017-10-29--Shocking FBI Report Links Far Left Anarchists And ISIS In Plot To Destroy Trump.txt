Wow. This is a shocker. A bombshell. A total game changer. Best-selling author Ed Klein just blew the whistle on what the FBI is calling the “greatest challenge to law enforcement since the Weather Underground and the Black Panther Party.”

According to the Daily Mail, the FBI had a top secret investigation into far left resistance movements across the USA with a focus on college campuses.

And they found stunning collusion between far left American anarchists and ISIS and Al-Queda.

“There is clearly overwhelming evidence that there are growing ties between U.S. radicals and the Islamic State, as well as several [ISIS] offshoots and splinter groups,” said the FBI field report which will be published for the first time in Klein’s new book, “All Out War: The Plot to Destroy Trump.”

According to Klein, the FBI monitored the far left as they traveled to Hamburg to protest Trump and the rest of the world’s leaders at the G20 summit.

“Task force covered G20 meeting in Hamburg, studied intel from local authorities, Interpol, and other assets, determined that as assumed U.S.-backed anarchist/radical groups had traveled to Germany and took place in the violence,’ the FBI’s report said.

“There is also evidence of meetings between these individuals and associates of ISIS. There is an urgent need to closely surveil the identified individuals.”

The report goes in to say that the far left anarchists met with multiple terror organizations in Germany and allege that one man even traveled to Syria to discuss tactics with ISIS.

The report makes clear that these far left groups want to commit violence and are gearing up for more.

Proving Trump right again. Share this if you agree.
