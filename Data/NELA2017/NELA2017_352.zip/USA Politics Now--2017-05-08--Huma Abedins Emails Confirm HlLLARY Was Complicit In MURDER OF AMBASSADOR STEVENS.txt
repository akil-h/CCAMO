Trump has been getting hammered from the media and liberals across the country for months that he will have massive conflicts of interest as president, given that he has business dealings all over the world.

However, Trump’s press conference just spent a significant amount of time on a statement from Trump’s layer going through everything he will be giving up control over. CNBC Reports:

Trump operates a variety of golf resorts and hotels around the world. The lawyer, who spoke to a small group of reporters on condition of anonymity, said all profits generated at Trump’s hotels by foreign governments will be donated to the U.S. Treasury.

Let me say that again, TRUMP HOTEL PROFITS GENERATED BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS WILL BE DONATED TO U.S. TREASURY!

No one ever saw that one coming!

USA Today reports, Trump’s adult sons, Donald Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump, will run the company, along with a Trump Organization executive. Trump will not make any corporate decisions during his time in the White House, his aides said.

Trump will put his business assets into a trust, and an ethics adviser will join the company’s management team. The adviser, who has not yet been named, will review and sign off on any new business deals that raise potential conflicts of interests, according to an attorney familiar with Trump’s plans.

The company also will hire a chief compliance officer to police potential conflicts.

Trump has promised he would do something so big with his business interests that America would be proud and he just kept his promise…big time!
