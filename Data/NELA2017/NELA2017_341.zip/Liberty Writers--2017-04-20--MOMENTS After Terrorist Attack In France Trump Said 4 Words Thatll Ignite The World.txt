President Donald Trump said that the shooting today in Paris looked “like another terrorist attack.” The U.S. president addressed the attack immediately this Thursday.

He said these fateful 4 words.

Then he said:

“First of all, our condolences to the people of France. It’s happening. I saw it as I was walking in. So that’s a terrible thing. It’s a very, very terrible thing that’s going on in the world today. But it looks like another terrorist attack,” Trump said.

“What can you say? It just never ends,” Trump said. “We have to be strong and we have to be vigilant and I’ve been saying it for a long time.”
