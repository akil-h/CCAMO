The liberal media has just been set on fire thanks to a new video from the Deputy Attorney General of the US that proves the Washington Post reports total BS!

The WaPo reported earlier today that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who wrote the memo recommending Comey’s removal, threatened to quit. Sounds kinda convenient…

That’s when Sinclair Broadcast Group‘s Michelle Macaluso tracked down Rosenstein and asked him directly “Did you resign or threaten to resign?”

The reporter first asked Rosenstein if he was quitting. Rosenstein gave a definitive.

That pretty much says it all. No real “wiggle room” there.

You can bet that President Trump is sick and tired of it all. Today he told TIME magazine,

Yes, Mr. President. It looks like they are incredibly dishonest.

The said part is, the  Washington Post could have simply asked Rosenstein himself. He clearly had no problem telling the truth.

The liberal media has already worked in tandem to spread this lie. Tons of people believe it, just like that stupid “Trump peeing” story.

That’s why it’s up to us to share this to every single person we know and set the record straight. The Comey firing was NOTHING like Watergate and this video proves it.
