Sen. John McCain loved the fact that Trump launched an airstrike on Syria and now is saying that Trump should go further.

‘Well, I think the fact that we acted was very important. And I support the president’s action,’ McCain said.

Here is what McCain said:

But the signal that they’re able to fly almost right away out of the same facility indicates that I don’t think we did as thorough enough job, which would have been cratering the runways,’ McCain said Sunday morning on Face the Nation.

Then Trump pulled out his secret weapon. He pulled out his construction knowledge.

‘And somebody will say, “Well, then they can fill in the runways.” Yeah and we can crater them again too,’ McCain continued.

Screw these fake Republicans. They jump on board and want us to fight multiple wars! Where were they when we need to fix healthcare?
