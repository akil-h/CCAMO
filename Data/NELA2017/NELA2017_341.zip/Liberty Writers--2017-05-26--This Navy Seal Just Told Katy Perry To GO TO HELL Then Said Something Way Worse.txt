Former Navy Seal Carl Higbie told Katy Perry that she should “go to hell” on Thursday for the comments that she made in favor of open borders after the horrible Manchester suicide bombing.

Higbie told Fox News Shannon Bream what he thought of requiring immigrants to take assimilation classes in wake of the ugly terror attacks in Manchester.

“You have people like Katy Perry…this woman has said ‘oh we need to give them hugs, hug it out,’” Higbie mocked. “Go to hell Katy Perry.”

Bream then said that she thought that Katy Perry meant well. Bigbie said that the statements were “benign” but they didn’t “understand any of this and they don’t want to understand, too. And that’s why I’m so strong against these celebrities who want to speak out.”

Ain’t that the truth. PC culture is going to get us killed, y’all.
