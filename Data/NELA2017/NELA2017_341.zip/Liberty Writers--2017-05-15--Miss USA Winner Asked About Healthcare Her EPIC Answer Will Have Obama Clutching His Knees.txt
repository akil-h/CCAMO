Meet Miss District of Columbia Kara McCullough. She was crowned the new Miss USA on Sunday in Las Vegas. This girl is just awesome.

She works in the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a chemist and she shocked the nation when she told the audience last night that she thinks that healthcare is a privilege. She also thinks that creating jobs is very important. Oh, and she also thinks that feminism is awful and man hating. Watch.

Hah! She has beauty and brains. This is amazing. She even said that she thinks that healthcare is a privilege and not a right. Take that Obama

The liberal crazies and social justice warriors were not pleased.

Ain’t that crappy. This is the problem with liberals. They eat their own for having different opinions than them. We’ll take Kara McCullough as a conservative, though. She’s beautiful. She has brains and is totally right about her opinions.

Share this everywhere if you agree with her! Let’s get our young conservatives on board with this. What an amazing rolemodel.
