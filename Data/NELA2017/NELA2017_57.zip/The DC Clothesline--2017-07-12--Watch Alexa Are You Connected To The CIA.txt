The user first asks if Alexa will lie to him, to which the bot responds no.

He then asks Alexa if it can tell him what the CIA is, to which the bot responds correctly after a second attempt.

Finally, the user asks the bot whether or not it is connected to the CIA, at which point Alexa simply shuts down or responds that it is having trouble.
