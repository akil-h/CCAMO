The Supreme Court has brought back the November 2016 ban on sale of firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR region.“Let’s try out at least one Diwali without firecrackers,” the top court observed on Monday, suspending the sale of firecrackers in the region. Though it is a dampener for many children and Diwali enthusiasts but it has come as a boon for the brokers and property dealers in the NCR region. They are selling the flats by mentioning the distance at which a person can easily light up a cracker.

Yes, brokers are adding ‘ 5 minute away from the nearest place where you can fire a cracker’ to the advertisements in paper as well as digital. Brokers always have a habit of mentioning unique places nearby the flat or apartment to lure customers. Sometimes it is nearby market, nearby station, nearby girls hostel, nearby liquor store and many other landmarks. But currently what people in NCR region are looking at is a place where they can fire some crackers. Many Delhites are booking tickets for locations where they can go fire crackers and come back to Delhi after Diwali. Many are actually visiting their relatives in other parts of India.

There are other brokers who are also adding the photograph of the place where crackers can be burnt, saying that it is a open field outside the border of NCR obviously and no one will come and stop you firing some crackers. It also mentions that the nearest police station is so far that the police wont even see the fumes and take any action. Customers are really showing interest in such properties, at least till this Diwali, after which they can obviously sell the property or rent it out for good money. Government, meanwhile is unaware of such advertisements.
