In November 2016, the current Detroit city clerk demonstrated her incompetence when 60,000 votes of Detroiters could not be recounted. However, over the past 12 years of her occupancy of the office of City Clerk, Detroit has witnessed a steady decline in the percentage of people voting. People do not trust that their votes will be counted, and they don’t understand the process. The current clerk does not reach out to voters. The last time her official FaceBook page was updated was in 2013, in a city where 70% of residents use FaceBook!

Peruse the following list for Michigan’s two largest neswpapers, national political organizations (you might recognize some of them), union locals, groups of political activists, local Democratic party organizations, an Indivisible group, and gubernatorial campaigns.

The union that represents employees who work for the current clerk (AFSCME) has endorsed Garlin. One of the candidates for Governor of the State of Michigan, Abdul El-Sayed, is sending volunteers every Sunday, as are others running for state-wide office. They know what the stakes are in Detroit.

You. Would you please help my fellow Detroiters vote? Polls that open late, elevators that don’t work, votes that cannot be recounted, unnecessary and confusing applications mailed to absentee voters: Smells like voter suppression to me.

Remember how the orange vulgarian won in Michigan by a majority of 11,000 votes? Detroit could easily make up those votes if we had a competent city clerk.

Who’s the Plus One? You. Please help us take back my city and your country.

Only 10 full days until the election!
