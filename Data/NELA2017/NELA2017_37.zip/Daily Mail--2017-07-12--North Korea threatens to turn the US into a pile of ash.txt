North Korea has threatened to turn the US into a 'pile of ash' if Donald Trump tries to use force to stop Pyongyang's nuclear programme.

Military intervention will 'inevitably lead the US to self-destruction', Kim Jong-un's state-run newspaper Minju Choson warned.

The threat came as the USÂ successfully tested its THAAD missile defense system against an intermediate-range ballistic missile in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii and Alaska - a key area as tensions with North Korea mount.

A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) near Kodiak, Alaska, intercepted the ballistic missile target that was launched north of Hawaii, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) said in a statement.

Although the test was planned months ago, the US missile defense test has gained significance following North Korea's July 4 launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that raised concerns about the threat from Pyongyang.

'The successful demonstration of THAAD against an IRBM-range missile threat bolsters the country's defensive capability against developing missile threats in North Korea and other countries around the globe and contributes to the broader strategic deterrence architecture,' MDA said in the statement.

U.S. officials have said the test would be the first of the THAAD system to defend against a simulated attack by an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM).

Earlier this week, Kim attended a concert to watch the Moranbong Band, an all-female ensemble that was hand-picked by the dictator.

Among the numbers performed were 'Song of Hwasong Rocket' and 'Make Others Envy Us', the North's official Korean Central News Agency reported.

The dictator was flanked by weapons engineer Jang Chang-ha after promoting him following the successful launch of Hwasong-14, which is believed to be capable of reaching most of Alaska.
