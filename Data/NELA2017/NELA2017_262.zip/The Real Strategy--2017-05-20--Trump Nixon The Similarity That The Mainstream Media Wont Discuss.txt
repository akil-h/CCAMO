Julian Assange Speaks Out: The War On The Truth

There’s a lot of chatter comparing President Trump’s current headaches to President Nixon’s Watergate debacle. The comparisons are pretty weak for sure, but there may be one common thread between the two men that the mainstream media won’t dare cover.

As this article from yesterday points out, President John F. Kennedy was hysterically branded a traitor who was committing treason for trying to befriend Russia.

JFK gave his famous “Peace Speech,” where he called for a dramatic shift in foreign policy of the U.S., an end to the Cold War, and peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union.

​Well, Nixon too eased tensions between the U.S. and Russia (as well as China).
