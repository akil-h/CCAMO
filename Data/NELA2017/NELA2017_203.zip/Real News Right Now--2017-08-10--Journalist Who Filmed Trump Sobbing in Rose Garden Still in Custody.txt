WASHINGTON, D.C. – A freelance photojournalist remains in custody nearly a week after he was detained by officers from the Secret Service’s Uniformed Division as he allegedly tried to breach a White House perimeter fence, a spokesperson for the Secret Service confirmed on Thursday.

Twenty-six year-old Samuel Parsons was detained shortly after 3 a.m. on August 2nd while attempting to film President Donald J. Trump, who, at the time, was pacing back and forth in the White House Rose Garden while sobbing audibly. “Sam left me a voicemail around three that morning saying he had footage of the president tweeting from the Rose Garden in a bathrobe,” Parsons’ editor, Druscilla Benoit, told The Guardian, adding, “I have not heard from him since.”

In a statement posted to the Secret Service’s official website, spokesman George Nichols said Mr. Parsons is being held at “an undisclosed location for his own safety” but has not been charged with a crime. “Parsons was found to be in possession of a recording device believed to contain compromising national security information,” the statement read.

While the White House has refused to comment on the circumstances surrounding President Trump’s late-night Rose Garden visit, a source close to the president told Real News Right Now that Mr. Trump is known for pacing the halls of the West Wing in his presidential bathrobe during the wee hours of the morning. “This is a time when [Trump] is truly in his element,” the source said, continuing, “He may get six, sometimes seven thousand steps in a night while catching up on Twitter.”

President Donald J. Trump, who is enjoying the first leg of a seventeen-day “working vacation” at his luxurious New Jersey golf club, is the first U.S. president to embrace social media as his official form of communication. Since taking office on January 20, 2017, President Trump has tweeted to the American people and the world more than 1,218 times.
