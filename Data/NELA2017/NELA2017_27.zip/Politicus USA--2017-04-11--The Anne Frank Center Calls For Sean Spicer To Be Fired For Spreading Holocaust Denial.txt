The Anne Frank Center has released a statement calling for White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer to fired for his evil spreading of the fake news that Hitler never used chemical weapons.

Steven Goldstein, Executive Director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, said in a statement to PoliticusUSA, “On Passover no less, Sean Spicer has engaged in Holocaust denial, the most offensive form of fake news imaginable, by denying Hitler gassed millions of Jews to death. Spicer’s statement is the most evil slur upon a group of people we have ever heard from a White House press secretary. Sean Spicer now lacks the integrity to serve as White House press secretary, and President Trump must fire him at once.”

Spicer has a fourth clarification of his statement, as provided to PoliticusUSA via the White House Press Pool, “In no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust. I was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers. Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable.”

The Trump White House has a history of trafficking in dog whistle Holocaust denial. It is possible that the White House press secretary forgot about the gassing of millions of Jewish in the worst act of mass murder and genocide in the history of our planet, but even if it is taken as a misstatement, Spicer’s words are inexcusable.

A press secretary in any other administration would be on the way out the door for such remarks. The Trump administration has been an exercise in expecting less and lowering the bar, but should never allow the bar to be lowered to the level of Holocaust denial.

The Anne Frank Center was correct. Sean Spicer should be fired, and if Trump doesn’t fire his press secretary, voters should fire Donald Trump.
