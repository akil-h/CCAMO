A lot of voter fraud takes place in places where it doesn't really matter. Ot doesn't matter nearly as much.

And then there's Broward County in Florida.

Broward County has certain electoral irregularities. Like the oldest voters on the planet.

Broward County, which has the highest number of Democratic voters in the state, has thousands of people over the age of 100 on its roll, and some as old as 130. In 2015, in studying Broward County voter data collected by the Election Assistance Commission, the Public Interest Legal Foundation found that at the time of the 2014 midterm elections, 103 percent of citizens of voting age in the county were registered to vote — an impossibility, of course. Four years earlier, in 2010, 106 percent of citizens of voting age in Broward County were registered to vote.

It's okay. There's a really great explanation.

A veteran Democrat chief election official in Florida has conceded in court that noncitizens and felons possibly voted, in a case that could have national implications for how localities clean up voter rolls. On July 31, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper reported that, in court, “Snipes acknowledged the processes her office [has] been using aren’t perfect and that some noncitizens and felons have voted despite not being eligible—especially right before major elections, when groups are actively registering new voters.”

Don't worry. We don't have extreme statistical improbabilities We just have voter fraud.

And remember voter fraud doesn't exist. Republicans just made it up to suppress the votes of 130-year olds.
