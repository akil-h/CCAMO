It's a longwinded Politico article (but I repeat myself) and yet the gist is obvious.

Obama allied with Islamist groups and Iran. Despite his Islamic heritage and hostility to Israel, he was too threatening to Middle Eastern governments. On the one hand he was backing Islamist revolutions and coups in places like Tunisia and Egypt. On the other, he empowered Iran's Shiite coalition.

Muslim Middle Eastern countries thought Bush was scary. But they found Obama a lot scarier because his calculus had nothing to do with American interests. Invading Iraq could be factored in. The overthrow of Egypt, the invasion of Lebanon, less so.

Trump is a lot less scary because his foreign policy is interest-based. Not counting the Saudis and Qatar, most Muslim governments don't care a great deal about immigration.

Never mind President Donald Trump’s Muslim-bashing rhetoric, he may just be a better partner. For months, leaders of America's Arab allies in the Mideast have telegraphed this view of the world, and it helps explain why the gilded palaces of the troubled, war-torn region are the few places on the planet ... where Trump has been more popular than the president he succeeded... “Clarity,” the prime minister says, and the hope for a more decisive approach is the reason why he and other Arab leaders prefer Trump, despite the bombast and uncertainty the first six months of his presidency have unleashed. Unstated, but by all accounts just as significant, is the expectation that Trump will take a more hawkish approach toward Syria’s backers in Iran, and Hariri repeatedly brought up concessions Obama made toward Tehran to get his nuclear deal as an example of how the U.S. lost its way in the region...

Idealism is a nice way of saying ideology. Obama's ideology gave him more in common with the Muslim Brotherhood and its ideology than with the more workaday governments in the region.

So much for foreign policy realism.
