According to a new Gallup poll, 64% of Americans support marijuana legalization, and for the first time in the history of the poll, a majority of Republicans also support legalization.

Gallup found, “Democrats and independents have historically been much more likely than Republicans to say marijuana should be legalized. In 2009, Democrats were the first partisan group to see majority support for legalization, followed by independents in 2010. This year for the first time, a majority of Republicans express support for legalizing marijuana; the current 51% is up nine percentage points from last year.”

Beneath Trump and the dinosaur viewers that power Fox News is a younger Republican Party that doesn’t share the same outdated attitude on legalization as cranky Trump. The Trump administration is so bad that everyone is looking for something to take the edge off, including at least 51% of Republicans.
