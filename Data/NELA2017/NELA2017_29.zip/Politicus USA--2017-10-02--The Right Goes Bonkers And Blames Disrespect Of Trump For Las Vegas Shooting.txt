The Trump right reaction to the worst mass shooting in US history is to blame a lack of respect for Trump for the violence.

Pat Robertson said, “Violence in the streets, ladies, and gentlemen. Why is it happening? The fact that we have disrespect for authority; there is profound disrespect for our president, all across this nation, they say terrible things about him. It’s in the news; it’s in other places. There is disrespect now for our national anthem, disrespect for our veterans, disrespect for the institutions of our government, disrespect for the court system. All the way up and down the line, disrespect.”

From the Alex Jones cult calling the shootings fake news to Pat Robertson blaming national anthem protests and disrespect of Trump, this is the backbone of the Republican Party. These people and their viewers are got Donald Trump the Republican nomination. Pat Robertson is no longer an outlier. He is the norm. The problem of mass shootings wouldn’t be solved with an honest discussion about guns in society. All violence would go away if people just respected Trump more and NFL players protested less.

Republicans can’t handle the fact that their law and order president who was supposed to be “making America great again” was in office for the worst mass shooting in US history. This is a bit unfair because due to Republican obstruction of all common sense gun reform legislation, it was likely that whoever won the election was going to be in office for the worst mass shooting in the nation’s history.

The right’s fantasy has always been that their strongman president would come and save the day, but the reality is that respect won’t prevent mass shootings. Better gun laws will save lives and go a long way towards ending mass shooting deaths escalation.

Kneeling for the national anthem didn’t get hundreds shot in Las Vegas, but it does make for a convenient excuse for those who don’t want to face the real issues behind gun violence in America.
