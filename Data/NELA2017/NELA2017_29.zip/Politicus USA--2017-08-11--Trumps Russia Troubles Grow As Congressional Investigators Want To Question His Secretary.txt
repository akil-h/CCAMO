The Russia investigation continues to inch closer to the President on a daily basis as congressional investigators want to question the secretary who handles his appointments and communications.

Congressional investigators want to question President Donald Trump’s longtime personal secretary as part of their ongoing probe into a controversial meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on Hillary Clinton, ABC News has learned.

“Since her name is in the email, people will want her to answer questions,” said Rep. Peter King, R-New York, a member of the House Intelligence Committee who knows Graff. “If you go into Trump Tower, you’re going to mention her name.”

The president, who has said he does not use email, communicated with associates for years through Graff. “Everybody knows in order to get through to him they have to go through me, so they are always on their best behavior,” Graff told Real Estate Weekly in 2004.

Graff is known as the gatekeeper to Trump, and her role hasn’t changed much since the President took office. If Trump had any communications about Russia, Russia collusion, or with Russians, they would go through Graff.

The investigations are hitting home for Trump. If he had nothing to do with the Russia scandal, why are investigators talking to his secretary? The answer is that despite Trump’s claims that the collision never happened, his secretary’s name was mentioned by the person setting up the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian representative.

While the world watches to see if the US will go to war with North Korea, the Russia investigations are moving forward. Quietly, with each passing day, Americans are getting closer to knowing the truth about the 2016 election.
