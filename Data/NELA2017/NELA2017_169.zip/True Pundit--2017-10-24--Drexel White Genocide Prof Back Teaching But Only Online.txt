The “white genocide” professor suspended after blaming the Las Vegas massacre on white people not getting “what they want” is back teaching at Drexel University — but only online.

Drexel University announced that it would allow politics professor George Ciccariello-Maher to teach his courses online after placing him on administrative leave in early October, reported Inside Higher Ed. The communist professor has received a deluge of support from academics, organizations, and fans on social media.

“In order to ensure academic continuity while preserving safety on campus, the terms of Professor George Ciccariello-Maher’s administrative leave have been modified to allow him to teach remotely for the duration of the term,” said the school to The Daily Caller News Foundation. “He will resume teaching his two scheduled courses online.”
