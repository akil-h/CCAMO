September 13 on ABC’s The View, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made her first talk show appearance since the election ten months ago, to promote her recently released memoir, What Happened. She sat at the table for over 40 minutes, fielding mostly friendly questions from the hosts.

While libertarian co-host Jedediah Bila asked Clinton some hard questions, the rest of the panel mainly fan-girled over Clinton, along with their adoring audience. Co-host Joy Behar even revealed when Clinton lost the election, she felt like a friend had died. “I went into mourning,” she gushed, showing a photograph of herself wearing a black veil.
