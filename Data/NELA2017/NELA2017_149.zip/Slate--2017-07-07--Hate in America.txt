Since the election of President Donald Trump, news outlets and social media accounts have swelled with reports of swastikas at schools, racist taunts, and other hate-fueled attacks and acts of intimidation. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which has aggregated media reports and gathered submissions from its website, catalogued 1064 such incidents, 13 of which were later debunked as false reports, in the first month after Trump won the presidency. (Twenty-six of those incidents were perpetrated against Trump supporters.) The SPLC has presented that data in aggregate, creating an invaluable record of the scope of post-election hate crimes.

Slate’s goal, in the curated feed below, is to present individual incidents of racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism, and anti-immigrant sentiment as we see them reported. We will update this feed frequently, and though our list is not comprehensive, we aim to make it as complete as possible.

If you find a report you believe we should include, an update to a previous report we’ve included in our feed, or information about a debunked incident, please submit it using this form.

This page is being updated periodically with new information.

*Update, Feb. 8, 2017: This introduction has been updated since it was initially published.

*Correction, Feb. 24, 2017: Due to a production error, a Feb. 24 update misstated the number of fatalities in a Wednesday shooting in Kansas. Only one man from India was killed, not two.

*Correction, March 6, 2017: Due to a production error, a March 2 update misstated the dates of four reported incidents. The dates of these reports have been corrected.

*Update, March 10, 2017: An incident from the March 2 update was removed because the original precipitating event occurred in 2013, not after the election. Thanks to readers who pointed this out.
