Five months after the 2016 presidential election, new evidence of voter fraud has appeared in Dallas, Texas.

West Dallas voters received unsolicited absentee ballots for an upcoming May 6 election in the mail, according to Lifezette.

Alice Washington, age 81, received an unsolicited mail-in ballot. Her niece Barbara Roberson requested a copy of the application from the Dallas County Elections office.

A fraudster requests a ballot, then monitors the contents of target mailbox a few days later, hoping to intercept the ballot. Then the forged ballot is mailed in on the chance that the resident may not show up to vote and the fraud (hopefully) won’t be detected.

Multiply that by potentially hundreds of ballots in a community and you could change a local election outcome. Multiply it by millions across the country and the results are unthinkable.

Pastor James Armstrong said that elderly churchgoers were being targeted. “It’s just a travesty that we are dealing with this. Seniors who have lived in this neighborhood all of their life and are now being taken advantage of,” Armstrong told KXAS.

This wouldn’t be the first time voter fraud has apparently hit the area, either.

Evidence also surfaced in November, when dozens of voters arrived at polling places only to be told they had already voted, according to the Dallas Morning News.

So far, 36 complaints about absentee ballots have been received by the Dallas County Elections Department. Administrator Toni Pippins-Poole is working with the District Attorney’s Office in its investigation of the documents and their source.
