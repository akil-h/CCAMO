Independent Journal Review brought a story about the ungrateful, whiny San Juan Mayor just moments after she met with Trump. It was obvious that she is serving her Democratic overlords and not telling the truth. The San Juan Mayor goes insane even more every time she’s on TV

The San Juan Mayor goes on TV and lies about Trump, that’s no surprise. This is just embarrassing for her because just hours after shaking his hand in Puerto Rico she made an appearance on CNN to bash Trump again. Let’s face it, that’s about all CNN puts on their airwaves anyway.

She was asked if she believes that Trump would continue to help Puerto Rico’s needs in the aftermath. Never mind the fact that Puerto Rico has enough supplies for the entire island for six months and the corrupt PUERTO RICAN official on the ground aren’t distributing the aid.

Never mind the fact that she gave Trump a glowing review just a week ago, this is what she said:

“Well, I sure hope so. But, you know, sometimes his foul communication gets in the way. We would have all preferred, and I’m speaking for myself, to just have him hear from us the reality on the ground versus ‘Alice in Wonderland’ and back to reality. So we saw two meetings, totally disconnected, one to another. One was to praise the people that are working here.”

Later, Cruz reiterated that Trump has a “lack of sensibility” and slammed him for joking that Puerto Rico threw the U.S. budget out of whack.

“I think his staff understands now, and they have all the data they need. But I would hope that the president of the United States stops spouting out comments that really hurt the people of Puerto Rico,” she said. “Rather than commander in chief, he sort of becomes miscommunicator in chief.”

What do you think of this disrespectful jerk?
