Fueling the hysteria on the part of politicians like Steve King and Geert Wilders, a blockbuster new report details how a lack of Christian fecundity may leave the earth to others.

“The proof that the Bible is correct [is] when it says that the people who are fruitful and multiply will take dominion,” says Campbell. “The more people born, the more the vote goes the way of the majority of people. If there are more Muslims, they will vote for their religion. If there are more Christians, there will be more votes for Christianity. This is a serious threat to [the] USA, which was founded as a Christian/Judaea nation and on the truths of the Bible.”

“I must add,” says Sandlin, “that the Gospel of John, chapter 17, indicates that one reason God created humanity was to share in the loving communion of the Trinity. In short, God wants man and woman to bear children because he himself wants children. Of course, they are not identical to his Son Jesus, who is deity, yet nonetheless, as creatures, they are meant to be his children whom [he] can love and with whom he can commune.”

Its conclusions are based largely on the faith of a child’s mother, with the assumption that children will adopt the faith of their mother until at least adulthood. While this is a strong signal of a child’s faith, it only takes into consideration half the parental equation in which partners or society may have an entirely different influence.

Additionally, a recent study by psychologists Will Gervais and Maxine Najle from the University of Kentucky suggests that—at least in America—the number of atheists figured by polling firms may be wrong. A Gallup poll from 2016 indicates that possibly up to 10 percent of Americans do not believe in God. Gervais and Najle believe that negative stereotypes of atheists might lead to under-reporting in surveys, and that the numbers might actually be double what’s showing up in polls.
