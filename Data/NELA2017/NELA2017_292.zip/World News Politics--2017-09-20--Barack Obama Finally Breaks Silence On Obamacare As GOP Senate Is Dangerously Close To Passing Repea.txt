Barack Obama finally breaks ground at the UN for the first time since leaving office. He broke ground by whining about the GOP trying to repeal Obamacare efforts. He can’t imagine why the government is opposed to such a horrific debt-driving program.

The Hill brought the story where Barack Obama told the truth about his ire at the GOP. He thinks that UN actually cares about what he has to say. They don’t care and neither do we.

That’s true, well the first part, it would raise costs. The raise would be a very short time. The reduction in coverage is malarkey because it would be another open market to all. As far as protections, it would eliminate the “protections” that the death panels give Americans. You know where death panels condemn you to death and protect you from freedom of choosing differently.

“When I see people trying to undo that hard-won progress for the 50th or 60th time … it is aggravating,” he said at an event in New York sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

This is the first time he has commented about the GOP trying to eliminate his program. This program has caused premium spikes and jobs to disappear. Numbers of insurers are dropping and it was all in an effort to make it difficult for the GOP to get rid of it.

“It’s certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple of months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents,” he said. “But typically, that’s how progress is won and how progress is maintained.”

Senate Republican leaders are going to be holding a vote next week on the Cassidy-Graham bill that would rollback the bulk of the provisions of the Obamacare fiasco.

The measure would cut off federal funding for the law’s expansion of Medicaid and subsidies to help people purchase insurance coverage, while block granting the money to states.

This is more whining from Barack.
