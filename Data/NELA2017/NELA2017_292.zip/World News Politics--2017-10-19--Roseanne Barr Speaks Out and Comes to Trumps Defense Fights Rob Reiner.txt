Roseanne Barr is a no-nonsense woman. She calls it like she sees it. Recently that led her to a run-in with dumbass Hollywood liberal Rob Reiner, as Political Insider reports. Even though Reiner brought us the quirky and popular movie the Princess Bride, if you took a look at his social media you wouldn’t know he’s anything other than another anti-Trump idiot. Roseanne has had enough of his guff and showed it recently when she started calling out Reiner on his “Russian BS” against Trump:

What Roseanne means by “Russian BS” is Reiner’s “Committee To Investigate Russia” which is a group of neoconservative idiots and Hollywood liberals who teamed up to say lies about Trump and Russia. The real story is Clinton and Obama helping Russia’s nuclear program, not Trump, but Reiner and his foolish creeps couldn’t care less, and got Morgan Freeman to make an insane video saying we are “at war” with Russia.” So lame.

Roseanne was not impressed. She knows the whole Trump Russia thing is nonsense. Even a CNN producer acknowledged recently that the whole Russia-Trump story is “mostly bulls***.”

If anyone getting in your face and calling you out would be intimidating it would be Roseanne! She’s a high-spirited woman, and Reiner likely got a faceful of her attitude calling him out on his absolute crap. Reiner is just another fake liberal creep who covers for Obama and Hillary Clinton and he deserves to be humiliated.

Are you glad Roseanne called out Reiner? What would you say to Rob Reiner and the other Hollywood liberals if you had the chance?
