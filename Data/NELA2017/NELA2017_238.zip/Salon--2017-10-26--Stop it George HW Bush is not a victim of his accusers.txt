Former President George H.W. Bush had to respond to allegations Wednesday after a second actress accused him of inappropriately touching her while he was sitting in his wheelchair during a photo op. Actress Jordana Grolnick had a similar story to that of "Turn" star Heather Lind, telling Deadspin , "I’m afraid that mine is entirely similar.”

In a now deleted Instagram post published Tuesday, Lind wrote that she was "disturbed today by a photo I saw of President Barack Obama shaking hands with George H. W. Bush in a gathering of ex-presidents." Lind went on to write that when she met Bush while promoting her TV show "Turn," the former president "sexually assaulted" her while she was posing for a photo.

"He didn't shake my hand. He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side. He told me a dirty joke. And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again," Lind wrote.

Deadspin reported that rumors about Bush groping actresses in this manner have existed for quite sometime. Deadspin reported receiving a tip over a year ago that Bush would grope actresses and tell them that his favorite magician was “David Cop-a-Feel.”

Bush spokesperson Jim McGrath provided the following statement in response to the reports:

At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures. To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate. To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.
