President Trump is attempting to dismiss a lawsuit alleging he has violated a constitutional rule restricting the president from accepting gifts from foreign governments.

The lawsuit was filed by more than 200 Democratic lawmakers in June on the grounds that Trump's failure to divest himself from his business interests has caused him to violate the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits the president from accepting gifts or benefits from foreign leaders.

Government attorneys blamed lawmakers for trying to bypass the legislative process by filing a lawsuit instead of trying to pass legislation to say Trump was guilty of abusing the Emoluments Clause, a court filing in a D.C. District Court revealed Friday.

"None of the bills has come to a vote, nor has the President done anything to prevent Congress from holding a vote," the motion states.

The lawyers requested the court drop the case "for lack of subject matter and jurisdiction or for failure to state a claim."

The lawsuit contends members of Congress remain in special standing since the Constitution requires lawmakers to approve gifts the president accepts from foreign leaders.

Trump has been criticized broadly for not divesting from his business interests since taking office and as a result, which puts him in jeopardy with the Emoluments Clause. Some critics have specifically take issue with foreign leaders visiting Trump's properties, which they are concerned was done in order to bolster their relationship with the president.
