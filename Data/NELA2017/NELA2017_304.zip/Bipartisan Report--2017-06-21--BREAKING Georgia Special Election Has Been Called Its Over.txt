In the riveting special election for the Sixth Congressional District of Georgia, final results have been announced. Polls showing no clear advantage for either candidate were released on Tuesday ahead of the race, adding drama to an already crucial election for both sides of the political aisle.

CNN is projecting that Republican Karen Handel has won the election with 52.4 percent of the votes and with 79 percent of counties reporting. Jon Ossoff has so far received 47.6 percent of votes at this time, 10:08 PM EST, according to the New York Times.

Georgia’s special congressional election has been, by all counts, the most expensive House race in history. Amid growing resistance to the president and the influx of GOP politicians in 2006, results were expected to make clear whether the GOP still has voters’ support or if that resistance is spreading to more GOP districts to demand change.

The race has also been, at times, a rather nasty one. Handel was slammed for her homophobic views such as those on adoption rights for LGBTQ parents as well as her jaw-dropping and highly inadvisable statement regarding American workers when she told voters during a debate with Ossoff that she does “not support a livable wage.” Attack ads by right-wing PACs hit below the belt, saying that a win for Ossoff was a win for violent leftists who cheered the recent shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise (R-LA).

The seat fought for by Ossoff and Handel was previously held by the Trump-appointed Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.
