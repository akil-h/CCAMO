On Wednesday, former Speaker of the House John Boehner said that President Donald Trump’s tax reform plans are nothing but “a bunch of happy talk.”

According to an energy-sector news source, RigZone, during his keynote speech at KPMG’s annual Global Energy Conference, Boehner said:

He also said that, like most people, he would have “never envisioned” Donald Trump being the President of the United States and that even though he has done “what he could” with healthcare, he really should have just been working to “repair” ObamaCare rather than “repeal and replace” it.

Boehner also suggested that Trump be banned from being allowed to tweet overnight, something most of America would agree with.

When asked if he would ever run for president, the former Speaker said:

Boehner also said that he didn’t “know why either of these campaigns (Hillary Clinton or Trump) were talking to Russians, but they need to get to the bottom of this,” and responded to some House Democrats’ calls for the impeachment of President Trump.

According to a report from Axios, earlier this month Boehner called President Trump when he was thinking about vetoing the bill that was passed by Congress for government spending. The former Speaker reportedly told Trump that he should be thankful that an increase in military spending was included in the deal and avoid a shutdown.
