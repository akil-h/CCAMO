Please won’t someone take Donald Trump’s phone

 Tell him we just want to be left alone

 No more snide tweets in the thick of the night

 Or vicious attacks that give us a fright

We want a prez who acts dignified

 Not one who writes like his brain has been fried

 Instead of tweetin’ whatever he’s thinkin’

 He should be aping leaders like Lincoln

Governing’s hard, it wearies the best

 Go bind up his thumbs, the man needs some rest

 Four years is too long to keep up this shtick

 We need a huuuge break, it’s making us sick

Without daily tweets life may be weak tea

 Which is how us losers prefer it to be

 Believe me silence would be a sweet tone

 So please won’t someone take Donald Trump’s phone
