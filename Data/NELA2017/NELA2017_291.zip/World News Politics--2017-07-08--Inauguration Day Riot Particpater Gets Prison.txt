A Tampa man was stuck with four months in jail Friday after taking part in an inauguration day riot that hurt six police officers and cost tens of thousands of dollars in damages in Washington D.C.

Dane Powell, 31, was caught on video sporting a black flag while tossing rocks and bricks at D.C. police officers and breaking store windows during the 30-minute riot that enveloped 16 city blocks, prosecutors said. He was also dressed in black and had part of his face covered.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff said Powell was seen in Logan Circle the day prior to President Trump’s inauguration with gas masks and carrying the same black flag seen in the video, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

“He initiated violence,” Kerkhoff said. “He came to the District of Columbia to engage in violence by hiding his face, throwing rocks and running. He’s a violent coward.”

Kerkhoff called Powell “among the most violent” of the defendants that participated in the riot.

“He was throwing rocks and bricks at windows where people, customers and children were inside,” she said. “He charged the police line with bricks.”

Powell asked Judge Lynne Leibovitz for “leniency” and asked for “forgiveness for anyone who was scared, hurt or felt threatened,” the Times reported.

Powell’s attorney Ashley Jones stated to the court her client, who spent nine years in the Army, did not go to the inauguration day riot to riot, but to protest in a peaceful manner. She also, in typical liberal fashion, blamed the cops for the violence.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Powell pleaded guilty in July to his attack on a cop and inciting a riot, which is considered felony charges.

Authorities said 234 people were arrested during the riots and of those, 198 cases are pending.

Do you think that his lawyer is a moron? Do you believe that all of these rioters should be thrown in jail?
