House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes told a Fresno, California, radio station on Monday that the attempted assassination that wounded Steve Scalise and three other individuals were “almost predictable” given the climate of political rhetoric in the fake news media and on the left.

Nunes was featured as the in-studio guest of KMJ’s Ray Appleton and gave an update on Scalise’s condition. He also discussed what possibly led to the shooting.

He said that it is a horrible situation, but it was predictable. He believes that we saw it more and more in the mainstream media, especially since the election.

The fake news advocates have been “refusing” to accept the results of the election.

Constant streams of visceral emails and calls that the GOP politicians have been receiving since the election is embarrassing on the previous liberals.

Yeah, oh yeah. We could tell by a number of visceral types of emails and phone calls that we were receiving — and still, receive to this day, I mean, they haven’t stopped.

Nunes has been denigrated by the Democrats and fake news outlets like CNN.

Devin Nunes said, “And the curtains have come down off of this whole — I always say that 90% of the news media is left-wing. But, you know, a lot of times they could disguise it. But now they don’t even disguise it anymore. You have 90% of the media who is essentially an arm of the Democratic Party and the far-left. You have 5% of the media who I think are legitimate journalists, life the folks you have at the KMJ news stood.”

What do you think of Nunes’ words? Do you agree that the rhetoric is partially to blame for the shooting?
