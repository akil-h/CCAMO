Just a bit after a Washington Post report said that Obama had knowledge about Russian cyber attacks during the election, President Trump joined the ridiculous conversation on Twitter.

Look what he said below on Twitter. Whewww!! Donald Trump doesn’t restrain himself.



 Trump is hitting back hard amid all the fake allegations that he colluded with the media. Months after the election, there has been no evidence of “collusion.”

Obama issued sanctions on Russia in late 2016 and approved the development of a “cyber-weapon” to be used on Russia to defend from further threats.



Obama has led to Americans being used to scandal and corruption. This is the man who guaranteed there would be a very transparent administration while he was running in 2007-2008. So when he became the most corrupt administration in history, it was a surprise to his voters, not to anyone else.

Why does Trump have to continually have to deal with this fake news story? Has anyone stopped to ask this?

It’s because the liberals and the mainstream media work for the globalists, it’s all about the fact that with Trump in power, they can’t accomplish their goal. It’s disgusting that they keep trying to control our nation and ruin American sovereignty.

The American dream is in jeopardy and Trump is protecting it at every turn. Is it time to fight globalism outright? Or should we continue supporting President Trump?

Globalism hinges on American prosperity. The globalists know they can’t accomplish their goal as long as America is a formidable foe. It’s time to disband the UN.
