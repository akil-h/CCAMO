Obamacare is practically done. Yes the AHCA isn’t perfect, but there is some good news.

Regan Pifer is reporting that the GOP’s healthcare bill passed in the House last week without the help of any Democrats. If this bill successfully passes the Senate, it will replace Obamacare. What comforting news, then, could conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer have for the left?

Krauthammer Predicts the United States Will Have a Single Payer System Within Seven Years. Krauthammer spoke to Chris Wallace on Fox News on Thursday and discussed the “success” of the GOP health care bill. He predicted, however, that within seven years, the United States “will end up with a single-payer system.”

Why Seven Years? He considered this the “midpoint.” “We had seven years of Obamacare,” Krauthammer contended, which produced “a change in expectations. And I would predict that in less than seven years we’ll be in a single payer system.”

Krauthammer Argues Liberals Have Already Won the Battle Over Healthcare. How so? Because of that change in expectation:

“Look at the terms of the debate,” Krauthammer explained. “Republicans are not arguing the free market anymore, they have sorted accepted the fact that the electorate sees healthcare as not just any commodity. It’s not like purchasing a steak or a car. It’s something that people now have a sense that government ought to guarantee.

And because of that, even Republicans are trying to say, ‘oh we’re not gonna lose that many, oh yes you’ll be covered if you have a pre-existing condition.’ The terms of the debate are entirely on the grounds of the liberal argument that everybody ought to have insurance.”

The question now is what should government cover, not if the government should cover it.

That is why the left has already won.

Whether the healthcare bill passes the Senate or not, Krauthammer contends the United States has officially left the land of the “radical individualist.

Obamacare is almost done.
