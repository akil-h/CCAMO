Justice Department officials and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating the wife of Senator Bernie Sanders. Over her role in the possibly fraudulent acquisition of nearly $7 million in tax-exempt bonds when she was the president of Burlington College.

An extremely massive expansion and fundraising effort spearheaded by Jane Sanders ended up bankrupting the tiny, private and now defunct school in Burlington, Vermont. It closed permanently in 2016.

Emails acquired through open records request by The Vermont Journalism Trust reveal that FBI agents and the US Attorney’s Office in Vermont have been analyzing Burlington College records for over a year. Also, the feds have subpoenaed at least one previous Burlington College employee.

That employee, former Burlington College dean of operations Coralee Holm, told The Vermont Journalism Trust that FBI agents questioned her about the fundraising activities related to the expansion.

Jane Sanders, who was the president of tiny Burlington College from 2004 until 2011, masterminded the expansion plan, which would have more than doubled the enrollment of the school (from about 200 full-time students to over 400). The plan required the college take on $10 million in debt to finance the purchase of an expansive new campus.

The real estate purchase backfired massively, leading to Sanders’s departure from the college and its eventual collapse.

The expansion plan involved the purchase of a 33-acre plot on the shores of Lake Champlain owned by the Catholic Diocese of Burlington. The prime acreage contained a three-story building, which was to be the centerpiece of the new Burlington College campus. The diocese was selling the property to help pay for a $17 million settlement of several sex-abuse lawsuits.

Yet people were clamoring for Bernie. The two leaders for the nomination of the Democrat Party live in scandalous homes. Good thing President Trump won.
