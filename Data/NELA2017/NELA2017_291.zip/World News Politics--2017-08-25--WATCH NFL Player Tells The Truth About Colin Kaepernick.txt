NFL Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy said what we’ve all known since this whole Colin Kaepernick “controversy” started. He’s just not that good. That is why he doesn’t have a job.

Numerous people have said that Kaepernick isn’t employed because he’s black. They seem to forget the bulk of the NBA and NFL employees. They’re predominantly black. LeSean McCoy disagrees. McCoy opened up to the media on this.

“It’s a lot more than just he’s not on the team because he doesn’t want to stand for the national anthem. That may have something to do with it, but I think also it has a lot to do with his play. I’m sure a lot of teams wouldn’t want him as their starting quarterback. That chaos that comes along with it, it’s a lot. As a team, trying to win and not have a distraction on the team, I just take that as a player – there’s certain players that could be on the team with big distractions, and there’s other players that it’s not good enough or not worth it.”

 

 It’s about time someone that plays in the NFL opened up about the matter. McCoy hit this right on the head. Numerous players have steered clear all the while some other degenerates have protested the anthem. It’s like a virus.

Kaepernick’s supporters try to act like he has a superstar future. He had a couple of good years under Jim Harbaugh. He had a great defense to carry him.

It’s fantasyland these Kaepernick supporters are living in. If Aaron Rodgers or Russell Wilson came out tomorrow in support of sharia law in America, both would still be on NFL rosters. Why? Because they are Hall of Fame caliber quarterbacks. That’s pretty much McCoy’s point in a nutshell.

McCoy will be called an Uncle Tom soon enough.
