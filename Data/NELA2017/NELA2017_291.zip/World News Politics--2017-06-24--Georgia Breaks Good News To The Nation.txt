Georgia is seeing a massive drop in the number of citizens using food stamps as the Peach State’s economy is still bouncing back from the Great Recession.

The number of Georgia residents receiving food stamps has dropped by 300,000–from 1.9 million in April 2013 to 1.6 million, via data put out by the state’s Division of Family and Children Services.

The 16 percent decline accounts for tens of millions of dollars in monthly savings for federal taxpayers.

Last month, 7,251 of the estimated 11,779 people taking food stamps in 21 Georgia counties stopped taking funds from the program—a drop of 62 percent, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

The growing decline follows as the state keeps expanding its work requirements.

The work requirement is currently in 24 counties, with 60 more counties boasting the requirements next year. The state’s goal is to have all 159 counties involved by 2019.

Georgia’s unemployment rate has returned to pre-recession levels; however, the fall in the state’s food stamp program has not fallen at the same rate.

State Sen. Renee Unterman (R-Buford) stated while food stamps should stay available for children and elderly citizens, able-bodied Georgians must be removed from the program.

“I think there’s a lot of fraud with food stamps,” Unterman said. “There’s a history of a lot of waste in our program.”

Unterman’s mandate is adding momentum in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump’s 2018 budget aims to save about $190 billion during the next ten years by requiring able-bodied adults to work to receive food stamps–similar to Georgia’s statewide directive.

The mandate is an excellent move to end all of the fraud that runs rampant in the “free money” programs run by the government.

What do you think of this? Do you think that Georgia is an example of the way the entire nation should move?
