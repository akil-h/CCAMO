Sydney Leathers has no sympathy for her former sexting pal Anthony Weiner.

“I hope he goes to jail,” Leathers told Inside Edition Friday, after the disgraced former congressman pleaded guilty to sexting with a minor.

Leathers sexted with Weiner in 2013 when he called himself “Carlos Danger.”

Weiner faces 21 to 27 months in prison, and will be required to register as a sex offender under the plea deal.

“I’m relieved, I’m happy for the kid that he was talking to,” Leathers said of Weiner’s 15-year-old victim. “I think that it sends a strong message that even people who are rich and powerful should get in trouble if they’re exploiting children.”

Weiner admitted to sending obscene texts to a 15-year-old North Carolina girl, whom he implored to participate in rape and role-play fantasies. Texts reveal he know the girl’s age at the time. He would “pretend like he was a teacher and I was a student,” the girl told the Daily Mail.

Leathers said she encouraged the underage girl to report Weiner to the FBI — a move that resulted in the agency’s re-opening of its probe into Hillary Clinton’s emails.

Leathers expressed support for Weiner’s child victim. “I hope she knows she didn’t do anything wrong,” she told Inside Edition.

Leathers said she’s happy Weiner is finally facing jail time for his indiscretions. “He has kind of gotten away with a lot,” she told Inside Edition. “He’s gotten slaps on the wrists for certain things. I think for once this might be something he can’t get himself out of.”

Hours after Weiner pleaded guilty on the federal sex charge, his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, filed for divorce.
