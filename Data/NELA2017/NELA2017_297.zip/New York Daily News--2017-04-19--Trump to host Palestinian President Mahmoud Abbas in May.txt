WASHINGTON â€” President Trump will host Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas at the White House on May 3, Trump's team announced Wednesday.

"They will use the visit to reaffirm the commitment of both the United States and Palestinian leadership to pursuing and ultimately concluding a conflict-ending settlement between the Palestinians and Israel," White House spokesman Sean Spicer said during his daily briefing.

The meeting comes as Trump has continued to promise to solve the long-running conflict in the Middle East, and after he hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as one of his first state visits.

Trump campaigned as a hard-liner on Israel, promising to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and support Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory. He appointed David Friedman as his U.S. ambassador to Israel, putting in place a man with deep ties to right-wing Israeli politicians. But he's offered a softer tone on Israel since the election, and hasn't made any moves towards shifting the embassy.
