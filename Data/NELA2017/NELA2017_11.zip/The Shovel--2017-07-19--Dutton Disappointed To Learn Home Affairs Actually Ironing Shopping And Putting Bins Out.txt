Peter Dutton has been given responsibility for doing the washing up.

In an unexpected extension of the portfolio, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has given Mr Dutton a long list of things that need to be done around Parliament House, preferably before the end of each working day.

A laughing Mr Turnbull said the Immigration Minister would have ‘a lot on his hands’. “I’m not sure Peter has picked up an iron before today, but he tells me he’s a quick learner, so he should be fine!” he said.

Mr Dutton will start on the toilets early tomorrow morning.
