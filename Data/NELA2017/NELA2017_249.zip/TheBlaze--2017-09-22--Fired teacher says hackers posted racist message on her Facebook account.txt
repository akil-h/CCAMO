Officials at a Mississippi school fired a teacher over a rant posted on her Facebook post about black people going back to Africa, but she claims hackers did it.

“If blacks in this county are so offended, no one is forcing them to stay here,” was the message posted on Cammie Rone’s Facebook page. “Why don’t they pick up and move back to Africa where they will have to work for a living. I am sure our government will pay for it! We pay for everything else.”

In a later post, Rone, who was a teacher at Batesville Intermediate School in Batesville, denied authoring the offensive message.

“Please do not accept any friend request from me. I think I have been hacked,” she wrote. “I keep getting messages about racist posts but when I go to my page I can’t see it. Someone screenshoted and sent me.”

“If anyone knows me, I post about cows, recipes and home improvements stuff not racism,” she added. “Please know I have not posted or made any kind of racist comments. Any questions feel free to call me.”

Rone, who did not respond to WREG-TV’s questions, can challenge the decision made by the South Panola School District to fire her.
