How do you get over a crushing quarterfinal loss at the US Open? If you’re Roger Federer, you get lunch with pal Bill Gates.

The tennis legend and the Microsoft co-founder were spotted breaking bread at Le Bilboquet on Friday afternoon, a source told Page Six.

According to the source, none of the other diners at the luxe French bistro bothered them or seemed to “care” that they were in the presence of the icons.

The casual Upper East Side lunch came less than 48 hours after Federer was bounced in shocking fashion from the US Open by Juan Martin Del Potro. Had he won, the Swiss star would have gone up against longtime rival Rafael Nadal on Friday night at Flushing Meadows.

This isn’t the first time Federer and Gates have made nice. The duo even hit the court together in April at the Federer Foundation’s Match for Africa 4 fundraiser in Seattle.
