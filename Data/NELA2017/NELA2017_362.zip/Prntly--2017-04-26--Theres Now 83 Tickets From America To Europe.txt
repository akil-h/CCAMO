The European airline price wars are growing even more competitive. In December, 2017 and January 2018 there are flight tickets from the US to Edinburgh, England for only $83. That’s right. $83.

The flights are out of either Newburgh, New York or Hartford, Connecticut. They are direct, non-stop flights with Norwegian air. They were only skyscanner and other booking sites, but with the way the algorithm works on airline flight sites, an airline ticket price will go up if a lot of people are looking at it, so by the time you’re reading this, the ticket prices may have jumped $10 or $20. But still, the news shows that airline tickets to take you across the pond to jolly ol’ England and elsewhere in Europe are continuing to drop lower than ever thought possible.
