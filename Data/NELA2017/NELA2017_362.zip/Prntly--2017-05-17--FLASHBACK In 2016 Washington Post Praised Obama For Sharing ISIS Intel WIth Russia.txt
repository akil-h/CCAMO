The media is going crazy that President Trump shared intelligence on ISIS with Russia, but in 2016 when Obama was President it was a different story.

The headline from 2016 on US cooperation with Russia on sharing top secret intelligence was much more positive then it is now. President Trump meanwhile is defending his decision to share sensitive information about an Islamic State threat with Russian officials.

President Trump focused instead on justifying what he did and blaming those who disclosed it. In a series of early-morning posts on Twitter, he said he had the “absolute right” to give “facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety” to Russia’s foreign minister and ambassador.

Asked about the conversation by reporters during a later appearance with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, Mr. Trump again did not deny providing the information, but he instead cast it as an attempt to collaborate with Russia in the war against the Islamic State. “We’re going to have a lot of great success over the coming years, and we want to get as many to fight terrorism as possible,” he said.
