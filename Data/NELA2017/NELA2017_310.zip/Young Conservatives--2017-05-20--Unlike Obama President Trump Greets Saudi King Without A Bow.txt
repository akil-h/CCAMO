Criticisms of President Trump are flying as he visits culturally-controversial Saudi Arabia—and the media’s having a field day.

But in the midst of the hype, mainstream news is failing to point out what Trump’s done differently from Obama.

The former president infuriated Americans by bowing to other world leaders all throughout his time in office—an accurate depiction of his approach to foreign policy across the board, no doubt.

Like the time he bowed to the leader of Japan:

But his most infamous bow was to the Saudi Arabian King.

Americans were NOT HAPPY about that one.

But true to his “leading from the front” attitude, President Trump just drew sharp contrast between himself and President Obama yet again.

Take a close look, now, at President Trump’s greeting of the Saudi Arabian King today:

No bows to be had.

It’s also worth noting that Melania forewent the head covering required by Saudi Arabian law—as have many female world leaders over the years.

But the real shocker in this clip is when the Saudi King shakes the First Lady’s hand—which is forbidden in the Quran.
