Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont today said he was shocked at the tactics Madrid had employed to prevent the independence referendum going ahead.

‘Of course I know they don’t want us to become independent. But to send in riot police to steal ballot boxes and attack people who were just trying to vote? I never expected they’d overreact this way.’

Suddenly three Spanish riot police in scarlet uniforms appeared in the room, accompanied by a horror film-style sound effect.

‘Nobody expects the Spanish overreaction!” said one of them, later identified as Cardinal Fang. ‘Our chief weapon is surprise, surprise and fear, our TWO chief weapons are surprise, fear and a fanatical determination not to let the richest part of the country break away and leave the rest of us up shit creek, our THREE chief weapons are… among our chief weapons are such diverse elements as… sod it, I’ll come in again.’

They then left, taking with them Carles Puigdemont who it’s feared may now be in a comfy chair somewhere.
