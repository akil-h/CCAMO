It’s been discussed for decades and on Friday Gov. Cuomo threw his weight behind plans to build either a cross Hudson freight tunnel or barge system to reduce the 14 million soot-spewing trucks that clog New York City’s roads every year.

Cuomo endorsed a Port Authority feasibility study to assess the merits of both proposals.

“Either alternative is better than doing nothing,” Cuomo said at a press conference at 7 World Trade Center.

He noted that Manhattan Rep. Jerrold Nadler — who attended the event — has been pushing for a freight tunnel since the late 1970s.

“We should have listened then. We should listen now,” Cuomo said.

But there’s a pressing multi-billion dollar question — who will pay for the projects?

Nadler said there are separate pots of federal funds for rail passenger and freight projects that could be accessed and wouldn’t compete with the Gateway project that would build another passenger rail tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey.

The study will be completed within 18 months, the governor said.
