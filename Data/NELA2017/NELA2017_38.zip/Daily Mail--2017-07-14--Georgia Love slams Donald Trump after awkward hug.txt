She was a journalist before quitting her job to pursue love on a reality TV show.

And The Bachelorette's Georgia Love has never been afraid to have her say on global current affairs.

During a Head to Head segment on Friday's episode of Today, she pulled no punches when she described US President Donald Trump's awkward hug with French First Lady Brigitte Macron as 'creepy and inappropriate.'

On Thursday, the US President raised eyebrows for his comments made to French First Lady Brigitte Macron, 64, during an official state visit in Paris.

Donald appeared to hold Brigitte in a lingering embrace before later telling her: 'You know, you're in such good shape.'

He repeated the remark to French President Emmanuel Macron, 39, before turning back to Brigitte to say: 'Beautiful.'

Georgia told the Channel Nine breakfast show the moment must have been 'uncomfortable' for Donald's wife Melania, 47, and other onlookers.

Describing the hug as 'absolutely awful,' the former WIN newsreader also said the encounter was 'objectifying.'

'That's creepy and inappropriate to be literally looking someone up and down like that,' she said.

'I just think imagine if he had said that about a man... He would never do that.'

Georgia shot to the spotlight after appearing on The Bachelorette last year, falling in love in front of Australia with mechanical plumber Lee Elliott.

The finale tragically coincided with the death of Georgia's mother Belinda, who lost her six-month battle with pancreatic cancer shortly after the show finished.

Since her stint on the reality TV show, Georgia has worked as a paid Instagram spokesmodel for several brands and appeared as a guest-host on Studio 10 and The Project.
