The NFL announced Friday that it is not seeking a mandate to force players to stand for the National Anthem.

The NFL said on Friday it has no plans to mandate players stand for the U.S. national anthem, but will rather present a possible solution on how to end the controversial protests when it meets with team owners next week.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, along with the head of the NFL Players Association, are meeting with the owners Oct.17-18 in New York to discuss a plan.

“(Goodell) has a plan that he is going to present to owners about how to use our platform to both raise awareness and make progress on issues of social justice and equality in this country.” “What we don’t have is a proposal that changes our policy, we don’t have something that mandates anything. That’s clear. If that was the case I doubt the head of the NFLPA would have put a joint statement out with us.”

Now Goodell is saying the NFL is not seeking a mandate to force players to stand. Brilliant.

Thursday night football ratings were also down.

The NFL is hurting as the disrespect of the national anthem continues.

Fans are burning gear, sponsors are dropping and stadiums are sparse; the NFL is done.
