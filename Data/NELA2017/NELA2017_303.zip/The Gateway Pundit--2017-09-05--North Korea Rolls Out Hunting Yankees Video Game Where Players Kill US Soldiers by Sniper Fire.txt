ICYMI, N.Korea rolls out “Hunting Yankee”, a new 3D game that lets players kill US soldiers "with a sniper gun" https://t.co/8ThStPI3oY pic.twitter.com/QtklYJtix4

“The 3D-amusement entertainment program ‘Hunting Yankee’ is a fighting game of shooting and knocking down Yankees with a sniper gun… behind enemy lines,” Arirang-Meari reported.

At first glance the game appears to be similar to Western first-person shooter (FPS) games like the U.S.-produced “Counter-Strike” (CS) or “Call of Duty” series.

A photo released by Arirang-Meari showed what appears to be a U.S. soldier being shot and killed by the player, with another photo depicting a soldier in the gun’s crosshairs.
