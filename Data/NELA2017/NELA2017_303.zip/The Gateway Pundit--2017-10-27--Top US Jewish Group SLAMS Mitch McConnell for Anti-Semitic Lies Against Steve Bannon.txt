Allies of Senator Mitch McConnell announced this week they will attack Steve Bannon personally in an effort to derail his attempts to hold the US Senate accountable to the base. McConnell allies are using left-wing talking points to smear Bannon as an antisemite.

 This is a disgusting new low for the GOP elites.

ZOA Appalled at Sen. McConnell/Josh Holmes Falsehoods on Bannon’s Views About Jews

Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) President Morton A. Klein released the following statement:

As the leader of the oldest pro-Israel group in the United States and as a child of Holocaust survivors, who was born in a displaced persons camp in Germany after losing most of my family to the evil anti-Semites of Nazi Germany, I am appalled by the reprehensible lies being promoted by Sen. Mitch McConnell, Josh Holmes, and the Senate Leadership Fund, about Steven Bannon’s attitude toward Israel and Jews.

Their disgraceful name calling is rubbish.

The Anti-Defamation League acknowledged that it has found no written or verbal statements made by Bannon that were anti-Semitic.

Steve Bannon is joining world-renowned Zionists Alan Dershowitz, Sen. Joe Lieberman, and United States Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, and Dr. Miriam and Sheldon Adelson, as an honored guest at the Zionist organization of America’s annual Gala on November 12th in New York City.

ZOA does not invite anti-Semites to our events. Steve Bannon is the furthest thing from an anti-Semite, contrary to McConnell and Holmes’s shameful lies. Steve is a proud friend of the Jewish people and the Jewish State of Israel.

I know and have worked closely with Steve Bannon. I am appalled by these shameful attempts to smear Bannon’s character and integrity by promoting false allegations about Bannon’s views on Jews and Israel. This is clearly being done because of policy differences between Senator McConnell and Bannon.
