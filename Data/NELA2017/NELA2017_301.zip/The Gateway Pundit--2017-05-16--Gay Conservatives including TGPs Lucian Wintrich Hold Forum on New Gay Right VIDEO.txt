Among the panelists was the Gateway Pundit’s own Lucian Wintrich, Fred Karger, the first openly gay presidential candidate in a political party in American history, Gregory T. Angelo, of the Log Cabin Republicans, and OUT Magazine’s Chadwick Moore.

The topics covered were filled with poignant as well as humorous rumination on everything from women, to Islam, to transgender rights, and gay marriage.

The following is a quote from the event wherein Wintrich commented explicitly on Islam:

Chadwick Moore made some great points regarding transgender students and restrooms:

“This is . . . essentially saying that any student in America can use any bathroom or locker room they like according to their gender identity or gender expression. And if schools don’t comply with that, they stand to lose federal funding. Which essentially made every bathroom or locker room in any public school in this country gender neutral.”

In all, the panelists did a remarkable job of outlining their stances and positions while also entertaining the audience.
