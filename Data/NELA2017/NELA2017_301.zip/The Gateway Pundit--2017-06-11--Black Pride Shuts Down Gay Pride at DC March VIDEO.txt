Washington D.C. – Thousands of people came out for the annual gay pride parade, waving rainbow flags on Saturday.

The parade was stopped dead in its tracks by Black Lives Matter activists.

Black Lives Matter stopped the gay pride parade chanting, “Hey hey ho ho these racists cops have got to go!”

This is a classic case of libs trying to out lib each other. Who is the most important victim?

The left doesn’t want Americans to unite as Americans. They have to keep people separated into victim groups in order to come in as their savior.
