The Supreme Court just made a decision on the block implemented by a federal judge in Hawaii that exempts relatives from Trump’s racist travel ban, targeting Muslims. The court upheld the ruling out of Hawaii that says it is unfair to keep immigrants from being able to see their family members, so long as the relative has no criminal history.

Hawaiian layer Neal Katyal says that it is immoral and plain cruel to keep a grandparent from their grandchild: “Compelling a grandparent to be apart from his grandchild — especially one seeking refuge from violence or persecution — inflicts hardship of unbearable severity.”

This has Trump climbing the walls, as he likely thought being president of the United States meant doing whatever you want uncontested. Never before has Trump seen this kind of opposition; he’s also unable to buy his way out of it.

It’s doubtful that Trump will see this as a victory, whatsoever. In fact, a Twitter rant is expected momentarily.
