As a result of his ego’s difficulty in accepting that millions of people didn’t want him to win Election 2016, Donald Trump has waged a crusade based on the premise of voter fraud. Trump contends that “millions” of votes were cast that shouldn’t have been, thus resulting in “massive” voter fraud.

Trump has gone as far as saying that people:

For starters, people can’t be legal or “illegal.” Secondly, Trump’s own daughter was discovered to be registered in two states. Third, the Federal Elections Commission found that Trump’s claims of voter fraud had no basis. In fact, FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub didn’t take kindly to Trump’s allegations. She called on Trump to produce evidence to support his claims:

To date, the Trump administration has produced nothing that substantiates their claims that there is “massive” voter fraud and “millions” of people are voting illegally. However, what has been substantiated in a court of law is that an Iowa Trump supporter tried to vote twice just as Trump is claiming democratic voters and “illegals” are doing.

Fifty-seven year-old Terri Lynn Rote, of Des Moines, pleaded guilty to election misconduct on June 27th, for attempting to vote twice for Trump, which is ironic, since millions of people didn’t vote for him once. Since voter fraud is a felony, Rote could face up to two years probation along with now being a convicted felon.

In an explanation only a Trump supporter could give, Rote said she tried to vote twice because she believed her first vote would be changed in support of Hillary Clinton. Although it makes no sense, Rote said she believed Trump’s claims of voter fraud, so she decided to commit voter fraud.

Rote was arrested in October when she tried to vote for the second time. She will be sentenced on August 15th.
