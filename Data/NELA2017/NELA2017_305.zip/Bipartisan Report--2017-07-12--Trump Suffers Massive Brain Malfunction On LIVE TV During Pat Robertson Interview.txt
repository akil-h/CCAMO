President Trump was all smiles when it comes to President Vladimir Putin in an interview with the 700 Club’s Pat Robertson that will air on the Thursday edition of Roberston’s show.

Robertson asked Trump, in light of his recent meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the G-20, whether or not the United States can “trust” President Putin.

Trump responded by praising the deal-making abilities of the Russian president, along with his own, saying:

‘Well look we had a good meeting, we had an excellent meeting. One thing we did is we have a ceasefire in a major part of Syria where there was tremendous bedlam and tremendous killing. And by the way this is now four days, the ceasefire has held for four days, those ceasefires haven’t held at all. That’s because President Putin and President Trump made the deal, and it’s held.’

He kept rambling, acknowledging in passing the seriousness of what he’s talking about but dismissing it.

‘Now I don’t know what’s going to happen. Maybe, as we’re speaking, they start shooting again. But this had held, unlike all of the other ceasefires that didn’t mean anything. So that was a great thing that came out of that meeting. I think a lot of things came out of that meeting, but I do believe it’s important to have a dialogue.’
