Following Vice President Mike Pence leaving a football game, he tweeted out an explanation as to why he walked out. Now, Donald Trump is taking credit.

When the Vice President walked out of an NFL game because some of the players choose to kneel, as they do every Sunday, in protest of police brutality against people of color, he felt the need to go on twitter explaining why. Considering his background and the administration which he serves, it wasn’t surprising that Pence couldn’t make it past the National Anthem without politicizing the NFL once again.

Pence explained in a series of tweets why he ultimately walked out, feeling that football players kneeling in the most peaceful of protests was extremely disrespectful to the American flag and the country in general.

Before conservatives could pat the Vice President on the back for his commitment to this idiotic notion that the #TakeAKnee protests have anything to do with disrespecting the flag, country, or military the president swooped in like a barn owl and snatched the attention back. Around noon Trump tweeted that the reason Mike Pence left the stadium was at his instruction and that he was proud that both the Vice President and his wife followed his orders.

The public reaction to Trump’s tweet was explosive, as you can see below in some of the many replies:
