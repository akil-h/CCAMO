Moments ago, Syrian air defenses engaged Israeli jets flying over Lebanese airspace which were inbound to attack the Syrian capital of Damascus.

According to Israeli military sources, the Israeli warplanes responded to the threat by targeting and destroying the SA-5 anti-aircraft missile battery that attacked them. The battery was positioned east of Damascus.

Syrian air defense forces confirm that they fired on Israeli jets, however have not commented on whether or not they lost an anti-aircraft battery.

Israel warplanes only ever fly over Lebanese airspace for one reason, and that is to attack Syrian pro-government forces in the west of the country.

Israel notified Russia “in real time” about a strike on Syria’s troops near Damascus, a spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) told TASS on Monday.

“Israel notified Russia in real-time mode about an airstrike in Syria,” he said.

An Israeli army spokesperson told a briefing earlier in the day that Russia had been notified in real time or immediately before the strike. The incident occurred ahead of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu’s visit to Israel scheduled for Monday. The spokesman affirmed that the Russian minister would be informed on the matter in detail.

According to the Israeli Defense Forces, Israeli aircraft targeted an anti-aircraft battery in Syria east of Damascus after an anti-aircraft missile had been “launched from Syria towards IDF aircraft during a routine flight over Lebanon.” “No hits confirmed,” the IDF spokesperson said.

“The Syrian regime is responsible for the anti-aircraft fire. The IDF maintains its ability to thwart hostilities against Israeli civilians,” the IDF spokesperson stressed. “Preserving the relative stability is a common interest. Israel has no intention of destabilizing the situation.”
