Another anti-Trump liberal is in BIG trouble!

The mayor of “sanctuary city” Seattle, Ed Murray, is facing charges for molesting a teenager back in the 1980’s.

The man from Kent, Washington, identified only as “D.H.” in the lawsuit filed in a state court, accuses the mayor of sexually abusing him in frequent encounters and paying him from $10 to $20 each time.

“I have been dealing with this for over 30 years,” the accuser said on Thursday, adding he’s been sober for a year.

He described the revelation as essential to the “healing process” of addiction recovery, coming to terms with “the shame, the embarrassment, the guilt, the humiliation that I put myself through and that he put me through.”

Murray is seeking re-election in 2017 and has denied the story as he cancelled a Thursday afternoon news conference on police reform. He has not been seen in public since.

Who on earth would re-elect a disgusting animal who RAPED A TEENAGE BOY?
