Muslim refugees are a national security threat. Their sons are an even bigger threat. Much of the terrorism that we are seeing comes from second generation settlers in their twenties and thirties. Even if the father never does anything, it's a matter of time until the son or the grandson does.

This is the tragic lesson that we seem to be unable to learn.

The Manchester Arena terrorist who killed 22 people, including an 8-year-old girl in the name of Islam was Salman Abedi. Salman was a 22-year-old son of Libyan refugees. The UK took them in and it paid the price. As it will pay the blood price for every single refugee who carries with him a racist and supremacist ideology that explicitly commands the killing and enslavement of non-Muslims.

That is why Salman Abedi killed. It is why he died.

A couple of months ago he [Salman] was chanting the first kalma [Islamic prayer] really loudly in the street. He was chanting in Arabic. ‘He was saying ‘There is only one God and the prophet Mohammed is his messenger’.’

It is why there are Muslim refugees and their sons all over Europe who are preparing to do the same thing when the signal is given.

ISIS gave the signal. And the rest was blood and horror.

If we do not stand up against the invasion of all the Salmans, eventually it will be one of our daughters in that stadium.
