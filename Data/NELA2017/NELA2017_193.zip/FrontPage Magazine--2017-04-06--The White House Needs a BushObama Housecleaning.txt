McMaster appears to have solidified control over the NSC. That's great news for anyone who thinks that the Bush admin had Islamic terrorism figured out and what we need is even more slavish adherence to Islamocorrectness.Meanwhile Yael Lempert keeps pushing the administration back into the same anti-Israel settlement freeze/negotiations swamp it was in under Obama.

At Gatestone, Soeren Kern has a good overview of the mess with a roundup of leftovers who shouldn't be there. McMaster is the old kind of bad. But there are truly outrageous figures.

Meanwhile, Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, who served as the NSC's Iran director during the Obama administration, is now in charge of policy planning for Iran and the Persian Gulf at the Trump State Department. Nowrouzzadeh, whose main task at Obama's NSC was to help broker the Iran Nuclear Deal, is a former employee of the National Iranian-American Council (NIAC), a lobbying group widely believed to be a front group for the Islamic dictatorship in Iran.

This is an ongoing problem because many of these people have a key role in shaping policy.

Trump's Israel policy is back to being made by the same people who made Obama's Israel policy. And so it has very predictably turned hostile with demands for a settlement freeze and a push for negotiations. On Islam, we're sliding back to the Bush/Obama consensus of not using the "I" word while pretending that Islamic state sponsors of terror are our allies.

The larger issue, as always, is that the left understands that it's the staffers who really make policy, not the elected officials. When you retain Obama's people, you retain his policies.
