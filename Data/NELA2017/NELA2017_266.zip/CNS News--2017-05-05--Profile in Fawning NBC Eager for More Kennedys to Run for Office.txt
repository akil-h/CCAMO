On Friday, Today show co-hosts Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie made it clear to viewers that they were ready for more Kennedys in Washington. Teasing an exclusive interview with former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy and her son Jack Schlossberg, Lauer proclaimed: “Caroline Kennedy returns to the states, set to honor former President Obama with a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. She’ll be here along with her son Jack, his first live sit-down ever. So what’s next for her and does he have a future in politics?”

Sitting down with the pair in the 7:30 a.m. ET hour, Lauer laid out Schlossberg’s resume: “You’re 22...24, excuse me. Graduated from Yale....About to go to law school at Harvard....People are going to get to know you now. You studied your grandfather [John F. Kennedy] and his legacy quite a bit. What did you learn by looking back at his life and his career?”
