Now that we know Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin circled back for a secret second meeting at the G20 summit, it raises so many questions it’s almost difficult to know where to start. What was discussed, and why did Trump and Putin need an extra hour of discussion after their initial two hour meeting? But one confirmed detail points to how and why things really went down the way they did. In fact it sounds a lot like they discussed something rather intensely personal.

The second “meeting” took place during a private dinner for G20 leaders behind closed doors. According to the Washington Post (link), “Halfway through the meal, Trump left his own seat to occupy a chair next to Putin.” So there’s your answer: Trump was so desperate to talk to Putin again that he essentially stalked him during dinner.

Was Trump merely trying to further kiss the ass of Putin, who is allegedly holding salacious blackmail material over him and has him by the financial balls? Or did Trump decide there was something further he needed to discuss with Putin that he didn’t feel comfortable saying in front of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson or Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, even though they’re both 100% loyal to Russia? There’s only one such topic that comes to mind: the mythical Pee Pee Tape.

Keep in mind that Donald Trump once made a point of calling up former FBI Director James Comey just to tell him that he hadn’t done anything with Russian hookers, according to Comey’s subsequent testimony. So we know Trump is obsessed with it. And there’s really no other topic that could have motivated Trump to stalk Putin for a second conversation, after the other two Russian puppets were out of earshot. Watch this all come back to the Pee Pee Tape.
