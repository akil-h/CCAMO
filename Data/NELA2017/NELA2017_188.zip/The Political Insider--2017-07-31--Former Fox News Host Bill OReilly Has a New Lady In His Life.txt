Former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly has been tweeting about a new lady friend in his life that has stolen his heart.

O’Reilly was let go by Fox this past spring after a series of sexual harassment allegations popped up, and a targeted campaign against him by liberal women’s rights groups forced the network to part ways with him.

So it comes as no surprise that any news about the former host and a new lady would turn some heads.

Holly has some big floppy ears, always needs to be cleaned up after, and leaves hair all over the place.

But we think you’ll agree, she’s still quite the stunner.

… as O’Reilly fades into the rearview mirror of history, he seems to have taken comfort in the love of a new friend named Holly. Who is Holly you ask? Maybe a leggy former Factor contributor? Between June 17 and and July 22 — mere weeks after his career ended in a blaze of ignominy —  Bill O’Reilly posted no less than 10 photos and 1 video of Holly.

The man loves his new lady friend. But he’s got a long way to go before catching up to former colleague Dana Perino, who provides social media followers with updates on her pup Jasper quite frequently. She even has a book about Jasper.

O’Reilly though, may already be following suit.

The former Fox News star can’t seem to get enough of his new pet.

It was learned earlier this year that O’Reilly had been accused of numerous instances of inappropriate behavior during his tenure, causing Fox News to pay out around $13 million over 5 years.

The popular host told fans post-firing that the allegations and subsequent targeting of his show, “The O’Reilly Factor,” “was a hit.”

“It has to do with destroying voices that the far left and the organized left-wing cabal doesn’t like,” he added.

O’Reilly has been the subject of rumors that he may be planning a comeback by teaming up with Sean Hannity.
