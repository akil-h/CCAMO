As if the Trump presidency hadn't already provided us with enough surreal moments, an interview on the CNCB channel last night gave us a whole new dimension to his state of mind.

While answering a question about trade embargoes with China, Trump produced an egg-bound chicken from an attach√© case and proceeded to manipulate the egg from its ovular channel by means of his mouth.

The interviewer, Chaney van Bilt, 37, was left speechless as Trump's attempts to wrest the egg from the clearly-disturbed hen lasted three minutes.

Sources close to Trump say he was suffering from a heavy cold and that, in fact, the chicken was an old wife's remedy he had borrowed from somewhere, y'know.

Van Bilt was unavailable for comment this morning but a spokesman said she had had a similar experience with Billy Joel and a terrapin and asked if she could be demoted to war correspondent with immediate effect.
