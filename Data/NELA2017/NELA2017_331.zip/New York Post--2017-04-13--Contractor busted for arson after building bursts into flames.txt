Fire marshals have arrested a local contractor for arson in connection to a raging Queens fire that left dozens homeless and injured more than 10 firefighters, officials said.

Declan McElhatton, 53, of Yonkers, was also charged with reckless endangerment on Wednesday after the blaze tore through a 7-story building at 94th Street and 57th Avenue the night before, according to the FDNY.

The fire broke out at around 6:30 p.m. Tuesday and quickly developed into a 5-alarm inferno less than an hour later, a spokesperson said.

Nearly 200 firefighters responded to the scene, and a total of 11 were hurt.

Seven of the smoke-eaters suffered minor injuries, while the other five were transported to local hospitals in serious, but stable condition.

They have all been released from the hospital, the spokesperson said.

McElhatton, who works for the Yonkers-based Maintenance Asset Management group, was busted by fire marshals on Wednesday. Officials would not say how he started the fire, only that he had been doing work on the building at the time.

The FDNY reported that the blaze had been caused by an open flame in close proximity to combustibles.

McElhattonâ€™s handiwork ultimately led to the destruction of 112 apartment units and the displacement of dozens of families.

The American Red Cross was said to be meeting with those who are affected for support.
