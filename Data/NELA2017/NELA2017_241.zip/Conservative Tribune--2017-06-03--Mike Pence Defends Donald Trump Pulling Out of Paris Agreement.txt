The left may be howling over President Donald Trump’s decision to renege on one of Barack Obama’s signature programs, the Paris climate change agreement. However, Vice President Mike Pence stands behind the president’s decision — and then some.

In an interview that aired Friday on Fox News, Pence called the Paris plan “an extraordinary burden” on the United States and intimated that the president might be open to renegotiating the accords if they placed more of the onus for carbon reduction on nations like China and India.

“What the world witnessed yesterday again was an American president putting America first,” Pence said on “Fox & Friends.”

“We’re putting the American worker and the American economy first,” the vice president added. “But you also heard him leave the door open to negotiating a better arrangement.”

What would a better deal entail? In a Thursday appearance on “Hannity,” Pence appeared to spell it out.

Calling the Paris Agreement “a bad deal from the moment it was signed by the (Obama) administration,” Pence told Hannity that it “puts an enormous burden on American consumers (and) on the American economy while allowing countries like India and China to virtually get off scot-free for a decade or more.”

The Paris Agreement was, as Pence pointed out, “an international treaty that was never submitted to the Senate, probably because it never would have had a chance there.”

If Obama had submitted it to Congress — as international treaties need to be — and it had been approved by the Senate, the left might have a point in its criticisms of Trump’s deicision.

However, without treaty status, pulling out of this job-killing agreement is as easy as a stroke of the pen — and we should be grateful that the Trump administration has decided to go in that direction.
