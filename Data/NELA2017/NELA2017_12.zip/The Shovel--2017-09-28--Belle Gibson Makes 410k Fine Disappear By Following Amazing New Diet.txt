Wellness blogger Belle Gibson has amazingly overcome the $410,000 fine handed to her by the Federal Court today, flushing it out of her system by eating gluten-free lettuce lasagne and tofu smoothies.

Ms Gibson, 28, said she looked forward to being an inspiration for other sufferers of criminal punishments, and will release a new cookbook in time for Christmas. An Instagram post captioned “#soblessed” showed an image of Gibson putting a range of fresh, healthy vegetables and her court order into a blender.

Penguin has rushed to publish the book, saying the claims seem totally legit.
