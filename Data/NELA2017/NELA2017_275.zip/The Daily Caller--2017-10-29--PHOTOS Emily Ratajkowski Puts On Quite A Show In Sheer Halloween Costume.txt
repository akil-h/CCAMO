Emily Ratajkowski put on quite a show when she headed out Saturday night in Los Angeles wearing a sheer body suit as part of her Halloween costume.

In the shot posted on Instagram Sunday, the 26-year-old Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model posed sitting next to a martini glass while sporting a purple long hair wig with a black mesh body suit and striped green and black pants. She used only black tape to cover up her nipples in the jaw-dropping outfit. The caption next to the shot simply read, “Boo.” (RELATED: 15 Things You May Not Have Known About Emily Ratajkowski [SLIDESHOW])
