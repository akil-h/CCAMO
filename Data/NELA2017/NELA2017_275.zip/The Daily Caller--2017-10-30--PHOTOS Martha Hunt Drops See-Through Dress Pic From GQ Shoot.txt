Martha Hunt left little to the imagination when she dropped a racy pic Sunday on Instagram wearing a totally see-through dress.

In the black-and-white shot from her magazine spread for GQ’s South Africa November issue, the 28-year-old Victoria’s Secret model posed with her back to the camera in a black sheer gown and white g-string underwear.

The caption next to the jaw-dropping pic read, “Issa new GQ @shotbybryce.”  (Watch The Victoria’s Secret Angels Music Video For the Weeknd’s ‘I Feel It Coming’)

Judging by the comments left by her 2.7 million followers, it’s clear the shot was a hit.

Another added, “You’re simply exquisite from every angle and in every light and color. What’s even more astounding is that your inner beauty, based on all I’ve read about you and heard of you interviews, is even more beautiful than how you look all the time.”

The lingerie model looked just as gorgeous on the cover shot of the upcoming issue that was shared in recent days, wearing nothing more than a little black slip.

Taking a glance through her social media account revealed more than just a few beautiful examples of why this model continues to make waves in the modeling and fashion world.
