A 34-year-old woman sitting in St. Louis’ Busch Stadium Tuesday night got quite the surprise after feeling pain in her elbow: she realized she had been struck by a bullet.

According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the victim felt pain in her arm around 9:40 p.m. and saw blood on her elbow after removing her jacket. She then noticed a bullet slug under her seat and headed for the stadium’s first aid station.

Fortunately, St. Louis’ Fox affiliate, KTVI, reported that the woman did not need to go to the hospital for her injury, which she called “a flesh wound.”

Although the source of the shooting is unclear at this point, police suspect the bullet came from someone outside the stadium firing a shot into the air. The Post-Dispatch said there were reports of shots fired at a nearby intersection shortly before the woman was hit.

The Cardinals organization released a statement in which it acknowledged the incident and provided information about the woman’s condition.

“We are aware of an incident last night in which a fan reported being struck by a stray bullet that presumably originated from outside of the stadium,” the statement read. “The fan was treated for an abrasion and a bruise on her arm at First Aid and released. She was interviewed by police who are investigating the matter.

“There is nothing more important than the safety of our fans, and the Cardinals are grateful that no one was seriously injured. We will be sharing more information with the media as further details emerge.”
