Big news, ladies and gentlemen, The Smoke Room’s domination of the internet doesn’t look like it’s coming to an end anytime soon.

Sorry to all the haters and critics out there. You might be asking yourself what the big news is. Well, we’re only now one of the largest and most successful organizations in the world when it comes to coverage of Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit models. Ever heard of them? I’ve been told they’re kind of a big deal.

We already overtook NHL.com, but I wasn’t satisfied. I’m still not content. I won’t be happy until we take over the entire internet. It’s a huge mountain to climb, but I swear on my ability to drink Miller Lite, it will get done.

When I took over The Smoke Room, I said we’re going to do so much winning it’ll be borderline sickening. We built a team of legends. I’m surrounded by the Seal Team Six of internet bloggers, journalist and personalities. Our best work is done at the dead of night. It’s already to late for our enemies by the time our helicopter touches down on the ground.

Lots of people want to spread the message that a bunch of people who enjoy drinking beer, watching movies, obsessing over sports, cracking a few jokes about the idiots in our society and talking about hot women couldn’t take over the internet. Those days were supposed to left in the trash can. Well, guess what? We’re out here thriving and those sites are dying.

And we’re not even getting close to stopping or slowing down. Beating the NHL and becoming known as a pillar of SI Swimsuit reporting was only the beginning. It was our first steps on the glorious hike up the mountain. We will continue to dominate, give the people what they want and take over the internet. As President Reagan once said, “You and I have a rendezvous with destiny.”

Get on board or get the hell out of our way.
