Giant agricultural companies that are producing GMOs and using millions of tons of chemicals continue to do so with the help of a large amount of monetary support. The longer we continue to purchase their products, the longer they can continue to operate in this way, poisoning our bodies and polluting our environment.

It is time that we band together, and put an end to the power held by these large companies. The best way to make a difference is to either buy from a local organic farmer, or grow your own, however this is not always an option.

When purchasing foods either look for any of these three labels: certified organic/USDA Organic products (which cannot intentionally contain any GMO ingredients), products bearing the “Non-GMO Project” verified seal (which indicate that they went through a separate certification process) or those products that carry the GMO Guard seal from Natural Food Certifiers.
