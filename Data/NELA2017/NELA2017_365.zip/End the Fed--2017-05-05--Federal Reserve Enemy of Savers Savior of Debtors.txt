The lives of financially prudent and responsible people have been postponed, complicated, or entirely ruined by the Federal Reserve and its despicable monetary policy.

Since 2009, the Federal Reserve has artificially suppressed interest rates to 0% and inflated the money supply by trillions in order to prop up insolvent banks, prop up insolvent governments, and perpetuate a phony debt-based bubble economy. Wealth has literally been stolen from savers and transferred to banks, governments, and debtors.  This isn’t just some abstract concept; it has had real life consequences for many people.

Retirees have been forced to return to work because income on their savings has been non-existent. To avoid being robbed, some have tried their hand at speculating in the financial markets, but have found that the “markets” are just rigged casinos with no rational price discovery. Younger families have had to postpone major life decisions such as buying a home because housing prices have been artificially inflated to pad the balance sheets of banks and underwater home “owners” who made bad choices. Still others have had to postpone starting a family because the cost of living is too high. Meanwhile, these same people have been forced to subsidize the reckless debt ridden lifestyles of other individuals and governments. These debt ridden consumers and governments are parasites bleeding savers dry.

Savings and capital investment are the lifeblood of a productive economy, not debt and consumption. The destruction of savers will lead to the destruction of prosperity. Savers should fight back by rejecting the Federal Reserve Note and begin saving in sound alternatives such as physical gold and silver.
