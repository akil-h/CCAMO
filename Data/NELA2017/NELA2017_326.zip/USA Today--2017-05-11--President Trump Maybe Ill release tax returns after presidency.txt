WASHINGTON — President Trump, who has repeatedly said that an ongoing IRS audit prevents him from releasing his tax returns, now says he might release them when he's no longer president.

In an interview published Thursday by The Economist, Trump was asked whether he might make his returns public in an effort to reach a deal with Democrats on his tax plan. Some congressional Democrats have clamored to see the returns, saying they are needed to determine how much Trump might benefit personally from his proposals, such as slashing the corporate tax rate and ending the federal estate tax.

"I doubt it. I doubt it. ... Nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters," Trump says.

"Oh, at some point I'll release them," he adds. "Maybe I'll release them after I'm finished because I'm very proud of them actually. I did a good job."

White House adviser Hope Hicks interjects to say: "once the audit is over," according to the interview transcript.

"I might release them after I'm out of office," Trump continues. He goes on to say that he would "never consider" disclosing his taxes as part of negotiations with Democrats. "It would be disrespectful of the importance of the deal."

Trump is bucking decades of presidential tradition with his refusal to make his tax returns public.
