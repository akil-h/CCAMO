On Friday, President Trump will embark on his first overseas trip as president, making stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican.

This trip will be the president’s first opportunity to represent the United States on the world stage, and it’s about to get off to a fantastic start.

During his first stop in Saudi Arabia, where the president will give an historic speech on Islam, Trump will be joined by none other than country music superstar Toby Keith.

The country music star faced criticism for performing at President Trump’s inauguration, but Keith refused to apologize for performing to our troops and country.

Toby Keith will perform in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, this weekend in an event that coincides with President Trump’s first overseas visit. The kingdom has recently loosened the reins on entertainment, including allowing musical concerts that had been banned for the past two decades.

Keith is known for his epic pro-America songs, including tunes about destroying radical Islamic terrorists. The choice to bring Keith is no mistake on Trump’s part. Remember this classic?

In addition to the concert, President Trump will attend a banquet with more than 50 Arab and Muslim leaders that will be hosted by King Salman.

Toby Keith exemplifies what it means to be an American. He’s the perfect person to travel to Saudi Arabia and show what our great country is all about.

Rather than apologize for America like Obama did, President Trump’s overseas tour will be meant to highlight American strength and prosperity, something that has been missing for the last 8 years.
