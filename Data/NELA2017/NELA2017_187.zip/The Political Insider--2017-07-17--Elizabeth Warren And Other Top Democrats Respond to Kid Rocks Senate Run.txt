Kid Rock took one step closer today to officializing his possible run for the Senate in Michigan. The rapping rocker tweeted out the following earlier:

Kid Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, drove speculation about his possible candidacy by writing the following on his website:

Once again the press is wrong. First of all, I’ve got 15 days from my announcement to file paperwork with the FEC! Second, I’m not signed to Warner Bros!!! – which simple fact-checking would have revealed. I have recently worked out a unique deal with BMG, Broken Bow, CAA and Live Nation to release music ON MY TERMS. Like politicians write books during their campaigns, I’m planning on putting out music during mine and IT ALL STARTS TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT. It’s not a hoax, it’s a strategy and marketing 101! No plans for an album or anything else that has been the usual norm in the music business OR politics…..and…..

While it’s still not entirely clear if Kid Rock is truly running for the Senate, Democrats are wasting no time attacking the Michigan musical artist.

His prospective opponent, Senator Debbie Stabenow, tweeted this out in response to Rock:

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and liberal darling Elizabeth Warren both sent out emails to supporters, begging for help against Rock:

Democrats are taking the threat of Senator Kid Rock seriously. They know that they are so weak as a party, that a musician with no political experience could actually oust one of them from the Senate.

I sincerely hope Rock throws his hat in the ring and goes toe-to-toe with Senator Stabenow. I predict he’ll whoop her in the election and go to the Senate to support President Trump.
