Bill O’Reilly has been in a bit of hot water recently.

He had to apologize over comments about congresswoman Maxine Waters that some people deemed racially insensitive.

Beyond that, he’s had to deal with several complaints of inappropriate behavior made against him over the years. The allegations have never been brought to court but have caused Fox News to pay out around $13 million over the last 5 years.

In an era when even the hint of sexual impropriety can get someone fired and even sent to jail, O’Reilly has been able to withstand the onslaught of attack and keep his prominent spot as number 1 host on Fox News and cable in general.

O’Reilly responded to the story and said that due to his position he is “vulnerable to lawsuits” from people who want to extract money from him. Fox News also said they stood by him.

Fox News standing by O’Reilly is a big sign. They’ve shown no problem getting rid of problematic employees, including former chairman Roger Ailes. If O’Reilly was an office menace and predator, Fox News would be obligated to fire him immediately. But that doesn’t seem to be the case.

Perhaps O’Reilly’s old school and brash demeanor shocks people. Or maybe O’Reilly was inappropriate in the past and will take steps to rectify it. We don’t know all the facts.

Regardless, he is keeping his time slot and will no-doubt continue to be a ratings juggernaut for the news channel.
