President Donald Trump held a rally in North Dakota on Wednesday in support of tax reform. The Liberal Senator Heidi Heidkamp flew with Trump to the event in North Dakota.

Remember, Trump won North Dakota in November with 36 points. After today’s tax reform rally, Trump called up the North Dakota Lawmakers on stage to support his tax reform. President Trump also vowed to cut taxes for the working class in America.

Share this if you are proud of our President. He is working his butt off and is working to make this country better again. The Republicans aren’t doing anything and the Democrats are obstructing everything.
