Former spy chief James Clapper appeared on CNN with Don Lemon on Wednesday. He went there to speak about the wiretapping of Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort. Watch the crazy interview below.

The video begins with Lemon asking Clapper about the stories in the press. Clapper then says that he “cannot comment” on the FISA warrant.

Clapper then stated that he “stands on” what he said about the 5th of March. Look at Clapper’s video below. Lemon then asked Clapper, if it “Is possible that President was picked up in a conversation with Paul Manafort?”

Clapper: “Uh, I can’t say. I -uh – wouldn’t wanna go there, but I will say, it’s possible.”

It’s time to lock up the criminal elements in Obama’s previous government. It’s time to drain the damn swamp. Share this if you agree and rejoice that it is about to all come down on them.
