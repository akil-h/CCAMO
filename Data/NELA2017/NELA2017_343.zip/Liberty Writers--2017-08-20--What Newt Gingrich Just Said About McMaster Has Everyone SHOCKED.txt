While many of us think it’s time for Trump to get rid of McMaster, Newt Gingrich has said this:

“He is the right person, in the right place, at the right time,” Gingrich recently said. “We are fortunate to have him serving the country.”

In fact, he titled his recent op ed for Fox News:  “We are Fortunate to have H.R. McMaster as National Security Advisor.”

McMaster has recently ousted several Trump loyalists from the National Security council, which has led many to be very concerned about where his loyalties really lie.

Billionaire Republican donor Sheldon Adelson has reportedly removed his support of McMaster, having learned that he is anti-Israel.

Is Trump about to fire another member of his administration? Would that be good?  Or bad? Trump recently said  “General McMaster and I are working very well together.”  Which way should Trump go?

McMaster strongly defended the President after he made his first comment about the violence in Charlottesville, Va.:

He said the President was “very clear” and that he “called on all Americans to take a firm stand” against the “bigotry” and “hatred.”

McMaster has become a very controversial figure.  Do you think it’s okay for him to stay?
