Mitt Romney ran for president twice and learned that America didn’t want him.

He’s had a really hard time coming to terms with that.

He hammered Trump during the campaign for no reason and it was clear that he would have rather seen Hillary in the White House.

Despite all of that, Trump entertained the idea of making Romney his Secretary of State.

You’d think that would shut Romney up.

While Romney earlier called on Trump to apologize, in the lengthy statement he released on Facebook Friday, he warned of dire consequences to the nation if the president fails to address his comments. “His apologists strain to explain that he didn’t mean what we heard. But what we heard is now the reality, and unless it is addressed by the president as such, with unprecedented candor and strength, there may commence an unraveling of our national fabric,” Romney wrote. “The potential consequences are severe in the extreme. Accordingly, the president must take remedial action in the extreme. He should address the American people, acknowledge that he was wrong, apologize.

Get out of here guy.

The country left you behind and I know it’s hard to deal with but just be happy you had a good run in the spotlight.

Making up reasons to criticize the president is detrimental to the country.

A very strange move for someone who always prides himself on how classy and moral he is.
