There’s no connection between Donald Trump and what happened in Charlottesville yesterday.

But, that hasn’t stopped the dishonest media from doing their typical blame racist Trump for everything routine.

It’s not just the media.  Elected officials are doing it too.

Check out what the mayor of Charlottesville had to say…

Charlottesville, Va., Mayor Michael Signer said President Trump shoulders some of the blame for Saturday’s violent protests in that city by white nationalists that left one protester and two state troopers dead. “Well, look at the campaign he ran,” Signer told CNN’s Jake Tapper when asked directly about if President Trump should take some of the blame. “I mean, look at the intentional courting both on the one hand of all these white supremacists, white nationalist group like that, anti-Semitic groups. And then look on the other hand the repeated failure to step up,condemn, denounce, silence, you know, put to bed all those different efforts just like we saw yesterday. I mean this is not hard.

It’s definitely a vile statement from the mayor but it’s also just factually incorrect.

There isn’t a single moment from Trump’s campaign that can be linked to this march. Not one. But, there’s the mayor pretending otherwise.

This is how the left operates though. They don’t have arguments. They just have personal attacks.
