That Al Gore guy sure is wrong a lot isn’t he?

Remember when he predicted major U.S. cities would be underwater in ten years if we didn’t do what he said on global warming?

That didn’t work out too well.

Al and his fellow liberals have been running around blaming global warming for an increase in hurricanes.

In reality, the hurricane that is expected to hit in Texas soon is the first one in a long time.

Thursday, August 24, 2017 marks a record 142 straight months since the last major hurricane made landfall in the continental United States. But that record major-hurricane drought may be coming to an end. According to the National Hurricane Center, Tropical Storm Harvey is “quickly strengthening” in the Gulf of Mexico and is forecast to be a major hurricane when it approaches the middle Texas coast on Friday night or Saturday morning.

So much for that whole global warming causes hurricanes narrative.

Gotta think of a new way to dupe people into paying attention to you.

Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Texas who are about to be affected by Hurrican Harvey.
