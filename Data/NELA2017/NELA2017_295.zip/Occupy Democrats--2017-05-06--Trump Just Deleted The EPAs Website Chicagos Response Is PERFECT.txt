After the Trump Administration quickly deleted any mention of “climate change” on the EPA’s website, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel took action by posting a new climate change page on his city’s website. It includes information taken directly from the Obama-era EPA’s website.

The introduction to the website reads:

“The City of Chicago wishes to acknowledge and attribute this information to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and other federal agencies for the decades of work that they have done to advance the fight against climate change. While this information may not be readily available on the agency’s webpage right now, here in Chicago we know climate change is real and we will continue to take action to fight it.”

Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt is not only a climate change denier, but sued the EPA, the agency he now leads, numerous times while Attorney General of Oklahoma.

 Per Politico, Emanuel said the Trump administration is trying to “erase decades of work from scientists and federal employees on the reality of climate change, but burying your head in the sand doesn’t erase the problem.”

The fact that Trump has chosen the utterly inept Pruitt to lead the agency charged with combating perhaps the most pressing issue facing humanity will undoubtedly stain his already abhorrent legacy as President. In the meantime, the rest of America – those who choose to accept reality – are fighting back. Cities like Chicago will not let a few backwards politicians in Washington decide the fate of this planet.
