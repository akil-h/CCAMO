Over the years, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart was a factory for some of late night’s most hilarious satirists. Next week, the Daily Beast reports, the biggest names will reunite for one Trump-bashing show that is not to be missed.

On Tuesday, May 9, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert will host a reunion show featuring not only the classic tandem of Colbert and Stewart but also, Last Week Tonight‘s John Oliver, Full Frontal‘s Samantha Bee, Ed Helms, and Rob Corddry.

With the Trump White House making an unprecedented power grab that has threatened women and minorities, the free press, and virtually everyone else outside the richest .1% of Americans, late night comedians have become a surprisingly effective line of defense. Jon Stewart’s protege’s have been leading the charge, and this should take the hilarious battle to the next level.

The coming together of six of TV’s funniest and most adept satirists is sure to incite Trump’s rage. The notoriously thin-skinned President has repeatedly sunk to the level of publicly attacking comedians who hurt his feelings.

To be certain this is a night of TV that Trump will not miss, and nor should we. Remember to pace yourself though. We’ll want to stay up for the presidential twitter tantrum that’s sure to follow.
