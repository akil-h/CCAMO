Tens of thousands of people across the country are participating in hundreds of March for Science events to mark Earth Day 2017.  They’re out in force to protest the anti-science rhetoric and actions emanating from the still very young Trump Administration – particularly the climate and science deniers in his own cabinet.

The President took time out of his busy Saturday grabbing photo-ops wherever he could to mark the occasion, but only enough to issue a tweet aimed at demonstrators lying about his administration’s anti-environmental policies.

But protesters didn’t care.  Along with their passion and their voices, marchers brought their wit.  We’ve collected a sample of some of the funniest picket signs from demonstrations across the country, and around the world.
