A cop on BBCs crime thriller Line of Duty is thought to be the first serving police officer in the history of TV cop dramas to ever complete his entire dinner without being interrupted by colleagues or called out to a murder scene.

The scene took place around half way through last Monday’s edition, when DCI Jason Beesley walked into the nick canteen, ordered a pasta bake with broccoli and carrots and for dessert an apple and rhubarb crumble with custard, topped off with a tea and two sugars and around 28 minutes later having left just a small piece of broccoli and a few carrots.

Beesley returned his dirty cutlery and dishes to the kitchen station, wiped custard from his chin, let out a loud belch and checked his phone. However, there was still nothing and it was not until he had nearly reached his desk that his phone started ringing. He said ‘Right boss, I’m on my way’ before heading off to the scene of the ritualistic murder of a surprisingly attractive young prostitute.
