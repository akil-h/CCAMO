Before the smoke had cleared in Las Vegas, liberals were already using the tragedy to push their gun control agenda.

We didn’t know who the killer was. What guns were used. How the guns were acquired. We knew nothing.

That didn’t stop the left from pretending they had it all figured out.

It was really pathetic.

Hillary Clinton immediately spewed out a lame attempt to blame the NRA for the violence.

That’s the left’s bread and butter. Pretending the NRA is somehow responsible for every single gun death.

The Washingon Post ran an article pretending to be appalled by the amount of money the NRA donates to political campaigns.

The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis made a Washington Post article playing up the NRA’s donations to members of Congress look pretty silly with one simple tweet. The WaPo story lists where about $3.6 million in NRA political donations have gone in the past few decades, but Davis pointed out Planned Parenthood political donations last year alone absolutely dwarf that number. “Reporter uses basic division on above tweet and you won’t believe what happens next,” Twitchy also noticed on Tuesday, calling out the article for being a bit overwrought.

You can’t pretend the NRA is this evil organization that controls Congress when Planned Parenthood does ghastly things and donates a lot more.

You have to at least try and be consistent.

Another swing and a miss from the liberal left.
