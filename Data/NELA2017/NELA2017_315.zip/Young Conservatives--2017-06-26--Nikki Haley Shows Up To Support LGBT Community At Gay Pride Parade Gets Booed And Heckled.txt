Nikki Haley has become a very popular figure in conservative circles thanks to the solid job she has been doing at the United Nations.

However, the liberal left still hates anything associated with Trump.

We told you earlier today that the Chicago pride parade was caught not letting some gay Jewish people in.

Looks like they didn’t really want Nikki Haley to show up in NYC either.

Isn’t that nuts? Republicans aren’t even allowed to show up to support the LGBT community.  That’s just absurd. Who is being intolerant here? Haley or the left?

Haley can handle it and there is nothing wrong with booing but it’s hard to imagine being that politically unhinged to the point where you would think it’s fine to shout down her family who is clearly not the least bit homophobic.

Donald Trump is the most gay-friendly GOP president in history and no president in either party has been as pro-gay as Trump when they first ran for office. There’s no debating that.  Obama and Hillary both didn’t switch over from the traditional marriage position until there was no room for traditional marriage in their party. Trump has been voicing his support for decades.

Trump isn’t focused or ideologically bound to the gay marriage or transgender bathroom issue. He has made that clear so many times.

All of this hysteria about Trump taking away rights from gay people is just that. Hysteria.  It’s completely made up.

It’s really a shame that people don’t do their research on it.

The GOP is the big tent party. The Democrat Party is not.
