Michael Moore appeared at “Stand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU” on Friday night, and discussed his time interacting with the non-profit back when he was a teenager.

After his segment on the livestream event, The Huffington Post caught up with Moore backstage, where the filmmaker elaborated on the various anti-Donald Trump statements he’s made recently.

“We’re already past the point, probably, of reversing what climate change has done to this planet,” Moore told HuffPost. “Some say we’re on the precipice, some say we’re too late, some say we’re going to be too late very soon.”

For him to tear up every single regulation instituted by President Obama on climate change and for him to say that that will no longer be a concern when they make their decisions, is not just a fuck you to the rest of this world, but it’s a declaration of war against the actual planet.

The documentary filmmaker has been vocal about resisting President Trump and contributing to future progress.

“Individually you all have to take a stand... We are now in the Trump era,” Moore said at Watch Us Run, HuffPost Women’s inauguration day event. “You’re going to have to put some serious thought into putting yourself on the line.”
