Macron Threatens Poland with Sanctions For Their Refusal to Take in Refugees

Looks like Macron is assuming the role of president, even though he hasn’t won anything.

The globalist French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron threatened future sanctions on Poland, who refuses to put their country at risk and take in refugees.

Globalist candidate  Macron has threatened Poland with sanctions if he becomes France’s new leader on 7 May.

Speaking to several newspapers he said: “When the rights and values of the European Union are not respected, I want sanctions to be taken,” referring to the refusal of Poland to take in migrants from Italy and Greece, Reuters reports.

The Polish government has also clashed with the EU on the subject of its judiciary, which the EU has claimed has been weakened by the conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) led government.

“In the three months after I’m elected, there will be a decision on Poland,” Macron said.

“You cannot have a European Union which argues over every single decimal place on the issue of budgets with each country, and which, when you have an EU member which acts like Poland or Hungary on issues linked to universities and learning, or refugees, or fundamental values, decides to do nothing.”

Hungary, like Poland, has also rejected attempts to redistribute migrants from other countries, recently rejecting 5,000 individuals from Sweden.
