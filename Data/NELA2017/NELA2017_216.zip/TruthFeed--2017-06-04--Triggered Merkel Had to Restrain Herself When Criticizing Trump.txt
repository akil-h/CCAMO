Triggered Merkel Had to “Restrain Herself” When Criticizing Trump

Liberals everywhere are LOSING IT over President Trump leaving the Paris Climate Agreement.

But no one is more upset than Angela Merkel.

The German Chancellor is more concerned and upset with climate change than radical Islam swallowing her country whole.

Apparently, Merkel had to “restrain herself” in her latest criticism of Trump upon his exit from the corrupt Paris Accord.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel called President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement “extremely regrettable” during a news conference Friday.

Merkel urged the rest of the world to “look to the future” and step up its ongoing efforts.

Trump’s announcement “won’t stop all those of us who feel obliged to protect the planet,” according to Merkel.

“The decision of the United States is extremely regrettable — and I am expressing myself in very restrained terms,” Merkel said.

“This decision cannot and will not … stop us. To the contrary, Germany, Europe and the rest of the world will more determined than ever bundle their powers … to successfully tackle these challenges.”

Merkel has repeatedly warned of a changing world order since the G7 meeting in Italy last week.

She believes a division within the western alliance has become evident after Brexit and the election of Trump.

She now wants Europe to take its “fate into our own hands” and become less reliant on the U.S.
