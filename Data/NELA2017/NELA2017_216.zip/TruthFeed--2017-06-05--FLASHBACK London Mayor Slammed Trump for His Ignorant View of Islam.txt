Mayor of London Sadiq Kahn slammed President Trump last year claiming that his restrictive views on Islam were ignorant and would make the U.S., as well as Europe less safe.

That statement didn’t age well AT ALL.

Had the U.S. been able to establish a travel ban and Europe followed suit, these last three terrorist attacks may have never happened in England.

London needs to wake up and get rid of Sadiq Kahn before their city is swallowed whole by radical Islam.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan previously criticized President Donald Trump’s plan to restrict travel to the U.S. to prevent radical Islamic terrorism from targeting American citizens.

Khan, the city’s first Muslim mayor, declared early last year that Trump’s “ignorant view of Islam” could make the U.S., as well as Europe less safe, The Telegraph reported.

“Donald Trump’s ignorant view of Islam could make both of our countries less safe — it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays into the hands of extremists,” he said last May, “Donald Trump and those around him think that Western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam — London has proved him wrong.”

Khan once stated that terrorist attacks are “part and parcel” to life in a big city.
