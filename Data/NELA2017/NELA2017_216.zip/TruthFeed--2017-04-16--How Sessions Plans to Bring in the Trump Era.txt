Jeff Sessions is currently positioning himself to bring in the era of Trump!

“This is a new era. This is the Trump era,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared from the U.S.-Mexico border last week.

Since he became the nation’s top law enforcement officer, the former Alabama senator has been carrying out many of President Trump’s campaign promises — and he has done so perhaps the most smoothly of any administration official.

Sessions may have had a rocky confirmation, but he has been “moving very quickly to do the things he said he would,” John Malcolm at the conservative Heritage Foundation told the Washington Examiner. And he’s carrying out his mission without a team in place.

Trump has yet to nominate hundreds of lower-level officials throughout the Justice Department, all of whom must be confirmed by the Senate. And yet, he is carrying out his agenda.

Here are some of the ways Sessions has done just that:

Sessions has directed all U.S. attorneys to step up prosecutions of illegal immigrants, especially those who have crossed the border more than once.

He also has ended the Obama-era policy of “catch and release,” which sends back illegal immigrants at the border instead of holding them for breaking federal law.

“Pursuant to the president’s executive order, we will now be detaining all adults who are apprehended at the border. They will not be released,” Sessions said.

Though the nation’s backlog of immigration cases will undoubtedly grow with the new policies, Sessions announced a new hiring bump to help speed up the process. And for immigrants who need to be sent to jail, Sessions has rescinded guidance from former President Barack Obama’s administration that directed the Bureau of Prisons to phase out private prison contracts.
