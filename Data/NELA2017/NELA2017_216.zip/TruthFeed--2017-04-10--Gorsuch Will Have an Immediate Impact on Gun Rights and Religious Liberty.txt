Gorsuch Will Have an Immediate Impact on Gun Rights and Religious Liberty

Judge Niel Gorsuch is set to have a tremendous and positive impact on gun rights and religious liberty cases.

We’re now set to move the Supreme Court back to the “right” side!

In his first weeks on the tribunal, Gorsuch and his new colleagues will review a landmark establishment clause controversy and decide whether to hear cases implicating the rights of gun-owners and religious objectors.

The justices will hear arguments in Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer April 19. The case asks to the Court to decide whether churches and faith-based organizations may be excluded from neutral, secular aid programs administered by state governments. The controversy arose after the state of Missouri denied a Lutheran church a grant to finance the purchase of rubber surfacing material for a playground operated by the congregation’s daycare.

Though the state provides funding for such projects at secular institutions, it denied Trinity Lutheran a grant because it is a religious entity.
