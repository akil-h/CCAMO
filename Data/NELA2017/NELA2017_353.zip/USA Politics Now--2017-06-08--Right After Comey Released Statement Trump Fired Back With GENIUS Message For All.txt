The media has been flying of the rails today about President Trump, y’all. The second Comey released his official statement, you can bet they started digging to find dirt on the President.

There was just one MASSIVE problem with their plan, and Trump noticed it right away…

President Trump was referring to his earlier claims that the FBI was never investigating him as an individual.

“The President is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the President was not under investigation in any Russian probe. The President feels completely and totally vindicated. He is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda.”

In the memo that James Comey released ahead of his hearing tomorrow, he made 2 things very clear:

Heck, don’t take my word for it, though. Here is the memo itself.

Now tell me that that right there ain’t some major B.S. The media trying to say this testimony damns Donald Trump. It does the opposite. And ever since it came out this morning, top Dems have been edging further from “impeachment” talk. I can’t imagine why…

So, now that y’all have seen the truth with your own eyes, help a President out by sharing this to all your friends and family and let the world see that Donald Trump is safe.
