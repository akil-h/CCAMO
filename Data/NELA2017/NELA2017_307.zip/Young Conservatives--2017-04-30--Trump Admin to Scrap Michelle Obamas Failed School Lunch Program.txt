There’s no way around it.

We documented it on this site several times which you can read about here, here, and here.

The visuals help tell the story as well.

Finally, relief appears to be on the way.

But now, all of that is about to be a thing of the past, The Hill reports. Newly minted Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is expected to unveil a new rule Monday aimed at giving schools more flexibility in meeting federal nutrition standards for school lunches. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced Friday that Perdue and Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) will make the announcement at the Catoctin Elementary School in Leesburg, Va., where they are expected to eat lunch with the students. Republicans have long been trying to dial back the standards that became a pillar of former first lady Michelle Obama’s initiative to curb childhood obesity in the U.S. Roberts introduced legislation with Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) last year to give schools two more years to meet new reductions on sodium, but the bill never passed. Renewed efforts to ease the federal standards came as disappointing news to some advocates.

Always nice to see power being shifted to the state level from the federal level.

Michelle Obama, much like Bloomberg, seemed to think that a problem like childhood obesity could be solved with rules, laws, and guidelines.

Like always, that’s not the answer.
