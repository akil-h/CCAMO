How long has it been since the baseball shooting where a leftists Bernie Sanders supporter tried to assassinate GOP Conngressmen?

Just a little over a week.

Where is that unity talk?

You wouldn’t know it from Hillary Clinton’s demonizing the Republicans once again today.

Her comments join others demonizing the plan and Republicans.

Ironically, it was the king of the ‘wealth transfers’ away from workers to non-workers, Barack Obama, who delivered the unintentionally ironic comment.

“The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill,” Obama wrote. “It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.” “Simply put, if there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm,” he continued. “And small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation.”

Bernie Sanders also weighed in saying again that people will die.

But no, Democrats are not responsible for heightening the rhetoric…
