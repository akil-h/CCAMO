Since Donald Trump won the election, talk about this wall has been a constant topic of discussion. First Trump said he didn’t know if we could “build the wall”, then he said taxpayers might have to pay for the wall, although he promised his supporters Mexico would pay for it. Now Bristol county Massachusetts’ sheriff Tom Hodgson, said he would offer his slaves, I mean, inmates to “build the wall.” Which I’m sure made Trump feel all warm and tingly inside.

Hodgson has not been shy about his disapproval of illegal immigration and has been very outspoken in the past about this matter. Therefore I’m sure this opportunity is extremely exciting for him. During his swearing in ceremony Hodgson announced, “I can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall.”

Hodgson is working toward implementing a program which he would call Project N.I.C.E. (National Inmates’ Community Endeavors). Through this program his inmates would build the wall to heal the world and make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. Clearly I’m overwhelmed with sarcasm but this is all talk at this point and there has been no confirmation as to whether this wall will be built.

Needless to say Sheriff Hodgson is working on a plan to figure out how this project can be funded and how they will work everything out logistically. We will have to wait to see if Trump will take him up on his offer.
