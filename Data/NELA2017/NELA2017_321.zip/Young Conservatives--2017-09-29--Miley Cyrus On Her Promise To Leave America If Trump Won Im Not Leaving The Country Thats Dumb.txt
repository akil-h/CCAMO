One of the strangest things that liberals did to voice their displeasure with Trump threatened to leave the country if he won.

At least 23 celebrities made the threat as if that would somehow convince Americans to vote for Hillary.

As you can imagine, none of them actually moved because none of them thought Trump would actually win.

It was nothing more than political theatre.

Miley Cyrus was one of the celebrities who said she’d leave.

“I’m not leaving the country, that’s dumb. Because that’s me abandoning my country when I think I’ve got a good thing to say to my country,” Cyrus told NME, People reports. “And trust me, I hear every day on my Instagram, ‘Just leave already! When are you going to leave?’ Wherever I am, my voice is going to be heard, and I’ll make sure of it.”

We all knew this is what would happen.

Still, it’s pretty entertaining watching these celebs admit how ridiculous they were being.
