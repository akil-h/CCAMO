(INTELLIHUB) — A high school teacher in Woodstock, Ga. was caught on camera demanding that her students turn their pro-Trump shirts inside out in yet another display of anti-Trump lunacy infecting the classroom.

The video, first released by Turning Point USA, is making headlines after the teacher directly compared “Make America Great” gear to literal Nazi swastikas. The teacher even went as far as to lie to her students by telling them they “can’t” wear the shirts, a rule she apparently made up on the spot.

“You cannot wear a swastika to school, you cannot wear ‘Make America Great Again’ like that,” the leftist teacher stunningly claimed.

“Please go, at least for this class,” she added. “I don’t care what you do in other classes.”

An unidentified student then asks the teacher if she is really trying to force a student to turn their shirt inside out simply because it says Trump on it. The teacher then confirms that this indeed was what she meant.

This epic insanity comes at a time when the mainstream media and the left in general have gone into full-scale propaganda mode against all things Trump.

Unable to actually debate ideas like a rational person, the left has now moved into labeling any conservative belief as racist hate speech so those beliefs can then in turn be banned from even being talked about.

Make no mistake, this is an all out attack on literally anyone who doesn’t support the new leftist orthodoxy and it is apparently not limited to adults as American children are now in the cross-hairs.
