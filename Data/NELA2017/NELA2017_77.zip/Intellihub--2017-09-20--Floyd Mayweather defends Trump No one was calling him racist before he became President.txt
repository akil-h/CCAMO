(INTELLIHUB) — Arguably one of the greatest boxers of all time, Floyd Mayweather, appeared on a broadcast recently where he talked about how people “shy away” from the fact that no one was calling Donald Trump a racist before he became the President.

“If y’all didn’t want the man in the White House then Y’all should have voted the other way,” Mayweather said. “He done his homework, he done what he had to do and he got there.”

The talented boxer with a net worth of over $400 million said that people need to focus more on what they themselves are doing rather than what the President and his people are doing. The champ also mentioned that President Trump’s “locker room” banter doesn’t bother him.

“Too many people are worried about what Trump is doing and what other presidents are doing,” he said. “You need to be worried about what you’re trying to do and what level you are trying to get to.”

The wound-up champ pointed out on the broadcast that he doesn’t need to worry about what anybody else is doing and said that his business is his 24/7/365 focus.

“It is what it is. […] I worked my way from the bottom to the top. Nobody gave me shit.”
