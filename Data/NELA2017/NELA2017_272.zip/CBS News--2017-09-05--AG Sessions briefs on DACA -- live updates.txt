Attorney General Jeff Sessions is briefing reporters on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program as President Trump is set to roll back yet another Obama-era ruling, effectively ending the 2012 program that has deferred deportations for those who came to the United States as young immigrants.

While Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday, "We love the dreamers", referring to the group of undocumented young people, adding, "I think the dreamers are terrific", CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett reports that the president is expected to end the program by not accepting new permits and by allowing existing permits to expire with no opportunity to reapply.

The message from the White House to Congress is that if lawmakers like DACA, they should write legislation for it, and the White House will consider it, likely favorably.

Mr. Trump tweeted early Tuesday morning after the Labor Day holiday weekend, signaling to Congress, who returns back to Washington from their August recess for their first day on Capitol Hill, that the job now lies in their hands.

"Congress, get ready to do your job -- DACA!" he tweeted.

While Mr. Trump is not expected to make a formal announcement himself, the White House legislative affairs team will reportedly be speaking with lawmakers on the matter, many of whom have expressed some concerns with the president's move.

The decision comes after a review by the White House. DACA has deferred deportations for people who entered the U.S. as children, and were under the age of 31 before June 15, 2012. Fox News first reported the president's plan to end DACA.
