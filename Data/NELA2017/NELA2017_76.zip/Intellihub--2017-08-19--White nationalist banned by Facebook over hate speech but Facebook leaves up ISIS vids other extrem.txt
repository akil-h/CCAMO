Is there really double standards for banning those who engage in hate speech on Facebook?

(INTELLIHUB) — Various Facebook and Instagram accounts connected to a white nationalist who attended the Charlottesville rally were deleted for violating the companies hate speech rules.

White nationalist Christopher Cantwell, who was recently featured in a Vice documentary on the rally’s aftermath, is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an extremist but says that Facebook’s maneuver blatant censorship of free speech.

In a phone interview, Cantwell told the Associated Press: “I’m not surprised by almost any of this because the whole thing we are complaining about here is that we are trying to express our views, and everybody is going through extraordinary lengths to make sure we are not heard.”

“Frankly, whatever you think of my views, that is very scary to me,” he said. “Facebook and Instagram is one thing but not being able to participate in the financial system because of your political opinions is something that, you know, people should worry about in America.”

Interestingly enough, Facebook may have double standards depending on what kind of so-called hate speech one engages in. For example: According to a PJ Media report, Facebook has refused to remove user-flagged (ISIS) videos posted by terror groups and has refused to remove user-flagged graphic sexual content picturing minors.
