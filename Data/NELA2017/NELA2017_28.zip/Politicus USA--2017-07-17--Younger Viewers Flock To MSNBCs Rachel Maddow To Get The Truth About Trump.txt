MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow is delivering the truth about Trump that viewers crave as the top rated MSNBC host is seeing younger viewers flock to her show.

Here are the numbers as sent to PoliticusUSA by MSNBC:

· MSNBC was #1 at 7 pm with “Hardball with Chris Matthews” (353,000), 9 pm with “The Rachel Maddow Show” (626,000) and 11 pm with “The 11th Hour with Brian Williams” (362,000) in A25-54.

· “Maddow” was the top cable news show in A25-54 for that week.

· “Maddow” was the #1 cable news show for the week (2.74 million total viewers).

· “The 11th Hour” was #1 in total viewers at 11 pm (1.64 million).

Younger viewers are flocking to Rachel Maddow’s show because she has been delivering the most consistent fact based coverage of this president and the Russia scandal. The Russia scandal is complicated. The basic point of the Russians interfering to elect Trump is easy to understand, but the rest of the story, all of the nuts and bolts that came together to build that outcome take some explaining, and no one is better on cable news at explaining what is happening with the Russia scandal than Rachel Maddow.

Fox News is falling behind because they have become state run media, and the endless primetime cheerleading for Trump has caused their ratings to sag. When a president’s approval rating is between 37% and 39%, it is going to weigh on the network that supports him.

Rachel Maddow is delivering the kind of coverage that viewers of all ages need in the era of Trump.

Younger viewers are tuning in, and hopefully, they will take their knowledge to the polls and vote in 2018.
