Donald Trump has lost more White House senior staffers than Spinal Tap has lost drummers. The erratic Trump has hired some of the most inept, unqualified, and simply ill-matched staffers imaginable – and predictably, they’ve been resigning as quickly as he can fire them. Now he’s about to suffer yet another major vacancy, under what might be the most controversial circumstances to date.

Trump somehow convinced Gary Cohn to give up the Wall Street life in favor of joining his sinking White House as an economic adviser. This went south after Trump openly sided with white supremacists and Nazis in the wake of the Charlottesville domestic terrorist attack. This led Cohn to consider resigning in protest, before ultimately deciding to simply lambast Trump in public. Now it turns out Trump is far from happy about having been publicly called a racist by one of his own top advisers. You can see where this is going.

Cohn had only taken the job because he thought Trump might appoint him as Fed Chair. But that’s apparently off the table now that Cohn has publicly condemned Trump. Worse for Cohn, Trump is now on the verge of chasing him out the door entirely, according to a Reuters report (link). So this means Cohn would have been better off taking a stand and resigning back when it still would have meant something, because it looks like he’s about to lose the job anyway.

If and when Donald Trump officially chases off Gary Cohn, he’ll join a long list of prematurely departed senior staff. Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer, Anthony Scaramucci, Steve Bannon, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, Michael Flynn, and Sebastian Gorka are just the headliners when it comes to Trump’s former key White House people. Trump just keeps ruining careers and ruining reputations as he goes. Who’s next?
