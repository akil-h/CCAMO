Attorney General Jeff Sessions has hired a private lawyer to deal with the ongoing investigations into possible collusion between Russia and President Trump’s campaign, according to multiple reports on Tuesday.

Washington lawyer Chuck Cooper confirmed to The Associated Press that he’s representing Sessions but would not offer any more specifics.

Cooper said in a statement that he won’t comment on any confidential client matters.

The two men have had a longstanding relationship, and Cooper advised Sessions ahead of his January confirmation hearing as well as on his testimony last week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

During his appearance before the panel, Sessions denied any suggestion he colluded with Moscow operatives to sway the presidential election, calling the idea “an appalling and detestable lie.”

Sessions has faced scrutiny over two contacts he had with the Russian ambassador during the presidential campaign.

He angrily denied suggestions that he had a third, unreported encounter with the ambassador.

The former senator from Alabama is also under scrutiny for his role in the firing of FBI Director James Comey last month.
