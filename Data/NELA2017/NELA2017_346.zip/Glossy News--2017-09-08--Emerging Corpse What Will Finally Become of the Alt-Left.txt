The Alt-Left is done!

No. The Alternative Left or ‘Alt-Left’ is an emerging political and ideological movement that is still in flux, and has not yet fully crystallized. Your one-sided expectations are entirely undialectical!

Ha! Ha! Ha! The idea of an avowedly libertarian-left backlash against postmodernists, regressive leftists and social justice warriors is a great idea, in theory; but many of those who advocate for an Alt Left are no more progressive than the people they are supposed to be distancing themselves from.

Well, not long ago you were banned from a certain group; for demeaning one faction as totalitarian.

And then another one! Do you remember why?

It seems you wished to take most one-sided and ‘undialectical’ stance against post-secularism.

But surely the choice between secularism and anti-secularism is a purely binary one?

On the contrary. You are either for or against. Sometimes, reality is binary.

Har! Har! Har! How very childish and unenlightened, ma chérie!

Perhaps the Tankies and closet SJWs infesting the Alt-Left right now will appreciate the following co-optation of a silly Marxist-Leninist propaganda move:

The right-opportunists want to have an Alt-Left by SJW means.

The left-infantilists want to abandon all the progressive and liberal values of the left.

Clearly, then, true Alt-Leftists have our work cut out to prevail against both deeply reactionary and regressive elements threatening the very survival of the libertarian left itself.

Why decide?

 Why not play it both ways, like we all do?

 Surely you are not so special, my little Diogenes?

I have nothing more to say to you.
