Broadway, get ready for some magic. North Hampton is coming to town.

The North Hampton theatrical creators of the hit play 'The Bully and the Cursed Child' are in exclusive talks with the Bollywood Theatre Group to bring the show to The Link Theater in New York.

The group is planning to spend millions of dollars preparing the Link for the show, the play's producers said.

The organizers plan will provide 'The Bully and the Cursed Child' with a bespoke home that will be intimate enough for a drama, yet deliver low priced tickets.

The play is about a peaceful minded group of school bullies who work for a fictitious leader called Buster, who is involved in a War with a rival female bully called Lizzy. Buster is the first bully to strike out after receiving sanctions from Lizzy who collects Buster's school lunch money and distributes free church food to hungry kids.

The drama puts into conflict the religious view points of a single member of Buster's gang and the groups intended mission of sneaking away with Lizzy's shoes during swimming classes to start a fight after school between Lizzy and Big Bertha who is Buster's older sister.

"Lizzy's getting clobbered now!", says Buster.
