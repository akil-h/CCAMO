A Syrian man named Abu is believed to be the fattest man alive and he is in love with Caitlyn Jenner according to celebrity gossip. His weight reached an incredible 500 kilograms and he smells like an old sardine can.

Iman Ahmad Abdulati, the man's father from northern Syria, says his son who now weighs in at half a tonne, hadn't left home for 25 years because of his size.

Ahmad has been desperate to find his son a wife and his prayers were answered a few days ago when Abu said he was going to marry Caitlyn Jenner after seeing her on a television interview with Diane Sawyer.

Sawyer is a direct descendant of the legendary Tom Sawyer who was used in a fictional story book by world famous author Mark Twain.

Abu's father wants Jenner to date and marry his son to take over the household chores of caring for him 24 hours a day. He needs to be bathed twice a day to ward off infections and fleas. He also has a bad case of blue balls that Ahmad hopes Jenner can cure.

"When I heard Caitlyn say she hasn't dated, it was clear to me I was the one to take away her loneliness." says Abu.

In the interview with Sawyer Jenner provides all the evidence: "I don't see dating in my future," Jenner told Sawyer. "I have never been approached. I have never been out on a date.

Still surprised, Sawyer interjected, saying: "That doesn't necessarily heal loneliness."

"On our first date inside my room, I'm going to give Caitlyn the honored privilege of changing my bedpan," says Abu.
