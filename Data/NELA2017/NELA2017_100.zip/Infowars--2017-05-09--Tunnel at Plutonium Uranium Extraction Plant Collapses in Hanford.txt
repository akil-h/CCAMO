Hundreds of workers were in “take cover” position after a tunnel in a plutonium uranium extraction (PUREX) plant plant collapsed at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation early Tuesday morning.

The AP reports no workers were in the tunnel at the time of collapse. Workers at the site have now been evacuated. Workers farther away were told to remain indoors.

A manager sent a message to all personnel telling them to “secure ventilation in your building” and “refrain from eating or drinking.”

The tunnel was full of highly contaminated materials such as hot radioactive trains that transport fuel rods. It connects to a PUREX (plutonium uranium extraction) building.
