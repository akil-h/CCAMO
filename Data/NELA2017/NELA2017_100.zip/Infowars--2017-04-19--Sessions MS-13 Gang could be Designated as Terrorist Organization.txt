Attorney General Jeff Sessions says the MS-13 gang could be designated as a terrorist organization.

Asked by Fox News’s Tucker Carlson on Tuesday whether he thinks the designation would be helpful, Sessions replied, “I think so, perhaps. I believe it could qualify for that.”

“There are rules that I guess the State Department does to establish that,” he added. El Salvador has already designated MS-13 a terrorist group.”

Sessions called the gang “one of the most violent gangs in the history of our country.”
