President Trump responds to a question about the controversial meeting between his son, Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer during the 2016 Election. Following is a transcript of the video.

TRUMP: As far as my son is concerned, my son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer. It was a short meeting. It was a meeting that went very, very quickly, very fast. Two other people were in the room, they — I guess one of them left almost immediately and the other one was not really focused on the meeting. I do think this: I think from a practical standpoint most people would have taken that meeting. It's called opposition research or even research into your opponent. I've had many people ... I've only been in politics for 2 years but I've had many people call up. “Oh, gee, we have information on this factor or this person” or frankly Hillary. That's very standard in politics. Politics is not the nicest business in the world but its very standard where they have information and you take the information. I have a son who's a great young man, he's a fine person. He took a meeting with a lawyer from Russia. It lasted for a very short period and nothing came of the meeting, and I think it's a meeting that most people in politics probably would have taken.
