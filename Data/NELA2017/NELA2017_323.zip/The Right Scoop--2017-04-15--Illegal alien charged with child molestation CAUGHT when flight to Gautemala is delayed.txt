In a week where airlines have been dragged through the mud, here’s a story where a delayed flight brought an evil person (allegedly) to justice.

The Caroline County Sheriff’s Office says a suspect who was wanted in connection to a reported sexual assault in Marydel on Tuesday is now in custody after he reportedly fled Delmarva and was located in Georgia early Wednesday morning.

Officials say deputies responded Tuesday to a report of a sexual assault of a juvenile in Marydel. From talking to the victim and her family members, investigators developed 19-year-old Sergio Leodan Morales Soto of Hartly, Del. as a suspect.

Police say deputies immediately began searching the area for Soto. Law enforcement was not able to locate Soto Tuesday night and prepared a bulletin with his information to send out to other agencies.

On Wednesday, police say members with ICE Homeland Security Investigations discovered that Soto had reportedly boarded a flight at BWI in the early morning hours. Investigators found that Soto’s flight landed in Atlanta at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and that his connecting flight was delayed due to severe weather in the Southeast.
