WE HAVE A TAX PLAN FROM TRUMP!! And boy, is it bigly.

Mnuchin is saying it’s the biggest tax cut in HISTORY!!!

Well. That sounds.. uhm.. hmmm. This is what I think of his tax plan: Judge Neil Gorsuch is awesome!!! Just kidding. I guess it’s good advice to not make the perfect the enemy of the good here. There’s a lot of good stuff here. Let us know what you think…

OK, so I’m seeing liberals whine and whine already that this is a huge tax cut for the rich. So let me address that: DUH. Liberals ALWAYS deceive Americans with this talking point and few conservatives are bright enough to argue back that the wealthy already pay the vast majority of taxes. So ANY cut in taxes will necessarily benefit the rich more than the rest of us. When FIFTY percent of people don’t pay ANY taxes at all, guess what – you can’t cut their damn taxes anymore.

So if that’s the big criticism, they can shove it up their Obama.

That doesn’t mean other critiques aren’t going to be substantive, but if you hear that one, ignore it while securely latching yourself onto truth and reason.
