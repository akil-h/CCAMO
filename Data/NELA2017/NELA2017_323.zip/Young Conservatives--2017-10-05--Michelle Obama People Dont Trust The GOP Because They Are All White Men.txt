Democrats today have become completely obsessed with identity politics.

They thrive on it.

They don’t see people as people. They see people based on their race, gender, or sexual orientation.

For some reason, Michelle Obama is still running around chiming in on politics and she just reaffirmed the idea that race is all the left cares about.

Check out what she just said about Republicans.

“We should be working actively to mix it up, so we’re getting a real broad range of perspectives on every issue. Shoot, I would see that in Congress,” she stated. “At the State of the Union address… when you are in the room what you can see is this real dichotomy. It’s a feeling of color almost,” Obama said. “On one side of the room is literally gray and white. Literally, that is the color palette on one side of the room. On the other side of the room, there are yellows and blues and whites and greens. Physically, there’s a difference in color, in the tone, because on one side all men, all white, on the other side some woman, some people of color.”

She just can’t help herself.  She just has to accuse the GOP of being too white and somehow inferior because they don’t meet her race quota.

Race controls everything in her life.

“I look at that, and I go, no wonder. No wonder we struggle, no wonder people don’t trust politics. We’re not even noticing what these rooms look like,” she added. According to Obama, the GOP being too white and male means “it’s hard to come up with the right answer [to the problems of minorities] when you haven’t lived it.”

This is the textbook definition of racism.

I’m not saying Michelle Obama is racist but this comment certainly was.

What is she talking about? No wonder people don’t trust politics. Look at all those white people!

Really shameful display from the former FLOTUS that will probably go over a lot of people’s heads.
