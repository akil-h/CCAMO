Sal Albanese wants to get back on the debate stage.

The former councilman, whose Democratic primary bid for mayor flopped but has the Reform Party line in the general election, is suing the Campaign Finance Board and sponsors of its first mayoral debate in hopes of being admitted.

Albanese has not yet been invited to the debate, which so far will include Mayor de Blasio, the Democrat, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican, and independent candidate Bo Dietl.

But in a lawsuit, Albanese said he believed he’d met the criteria.

“The people of our City deserve a full and fair debate of the issues impacting our future and the Campaign Finance Board, financed by taxpayer dollars, must not be allowed to arbitrarily restrict how that debate proceeds or who should be allowed to participate,” he said in a statement.

To qualify, a candidate must raise and spend $500,000 by Oct. 6 — which the three included candidates have done — or must raise and spend $174,225, and garner 8% of the vote in a poll by either Marist or Quinnipiac.

Albanese has spent about $190,000, but has not been included in any polls that would qualify him for the debate.

But his campaign argues he should have been included, since he’ll be on the ballot, and shouldn’t be held responsible for incomplete polling.

If Albanese had been included in the polls, every other candidate on the ballot — including Green Party candidate Akeem Browder, independent Michael Tolkin and others — would have also had to be included for the poll to qualify under the CFB rules.

His legal petition asks a judge to stop the debate from happening Oct. 10 if he’s not included.
