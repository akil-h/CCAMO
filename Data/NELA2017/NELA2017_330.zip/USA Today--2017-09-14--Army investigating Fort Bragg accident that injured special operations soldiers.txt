At least 15 special operations soldiers were injured in accident at Fort Bragg, N.C., Thursday, Army officials said.

Authorities said the soldiers were transported via medical helicopter to Womack Army Medical Center after an explosion on one of the training fields. At least one of those soldiers was later transferred to UNC Hospital, WRAL TV reported.

Lt. Col. Rob Bockholt, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's Special Operations Command, told the Associated Press that didn't yet know the extent of the soldiers' injuries. He also could not say what exactly caused them.

"There was an incident that occurred on one of the ranges," Bockholt said, adding that the command is investigating. "We're looking into exactly what happened."

About 57,000 military personnel are attached to Fort Bragg, located next to Fayetteville, N.C. It is the largest Army installation by population and covers about 161,000 acres. The Special Operations Command has about 23,000 soldiers spread over several sites.
