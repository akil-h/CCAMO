Sen. John McCain’s daughter, Meghan McCain, is leaving Fox News “to focus on other things.”

McCain confirmed the news, first reported by Variety, in a series of tweets.

McCain was a panelist of Fox’s show Outnumbered, which featured a group of women panelists and one rotating man.

“Meghan has been a valuable part of Outnumbered and the Fox News team. We’re sad to see her go, but we wish her all the best,” Fox News said in a statement.

McCain’s father, the senior GOP senator from Arizona, announced this summer he had brain cancer. He has been receiving treatments while doing his work in Washington.
