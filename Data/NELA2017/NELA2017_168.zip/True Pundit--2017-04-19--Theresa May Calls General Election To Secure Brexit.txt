British Prime Minister Theresa May announced Tuesday that a general election will take place June 8, saying a “division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit.”

May made the surprising announcement after a meeting with her cabinet. The prime minister said the country needed stability and strong leadership following the referendum to leave the European Union.

“It is with strong conviction that I believe it is necessary to secure a strong and stable leadership this country needs,” May said. “The country is coming together, but Westminster is not.”

May further called on parties to present their plans for Brexit and leave it all in the hands of the people. The House of Commons will vote on the proposed election Wednesday.

“I have concluded the only way to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead is to hold this election,” May said.

The snap election could play to May’s advantage. Support for her handling of Brexit is at a five-month high with 55 percent of the population backing her, according to a poll released Saturday.
