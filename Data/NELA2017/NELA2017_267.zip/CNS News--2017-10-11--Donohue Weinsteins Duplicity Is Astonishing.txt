"We're gonna have to get as organized as the Mafia," Weinstein said. "We just can't take it anymore. We just can't take these things. There's gotta be a way to fight back." He was given the Humanitarian Award by Christoph Waltz, who praised him for making movies that made Jews proud of their heritage.

I join Weinstein in condemning anti-Semitism. But before I am prepared to issue a joint statement with him, he needs to first condemn anti-Catholicism and pledge not to contribute to it again.

In 1995, Weinstein and his brother, Bob, offered us "Priest," a film featuring nothing but miscreant priests. In 1998, they gave us "The Butcher Boy," which starred Sinead O'Connor as a foul-mouthed Virgin Mary. In 1999, we were treated to "Dogma," where the audience learned of a descendant of Mary and Joseph who works in an abortion clinic.

In 2002, they released "40 Days and 40 Nights," a film that ridiculed a Catholic for giving up sex for Lent. Also opening in 2002 was "The Magdalene Sisters," a movie that smeared nuns. In 2003, "Bad Santa" opened for the holidays; Santa was cast as a chain-smoking, drunken, foul-mouthed, suicidal, sexual predator. In 2006, "Black Christmas" made a predictably dark statement about the holiday.

In 2013, they released "Philomena," a tale of malicious lies about Irish nuns and the Church (Harvey lobbied hard for an Oscar, but came up empty). In real life, Philomena Lee was a teenager who abandoned her out-of-wedlock son, and who, because of the good efforts of the nuns, was adopted by an American couple.

Anti-Catholicism and anti-Semitism should both be condemned, without equivocation. Condemning one but not the other is irresponsible, though it is fashionable to do so.
