Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe tweeted a bombshell video late Monday evening of CNN Producer John Bonifield conceding that the network intentionally dominates airtime with Russia coverage and is not concerned with journalistic ethics.

Bonifield mentions CNN CEO Jeff Zucker, and says he intentionally directed coverage away from the climate accord and back to Russia.

In the video, Bonifield says CNN is constantly covering Russia “because ratings.”

“I just feel like they don’t really have it, but they want to keep digging. And so I think the President is probably right to say, like, look, you are witch hunting me, like, you have no smoking gun. You have no real proof.”

This is such an insanely huge bombshell.

These are concessions coming from a producer who’s worked for CNN for roughly 15 years.
