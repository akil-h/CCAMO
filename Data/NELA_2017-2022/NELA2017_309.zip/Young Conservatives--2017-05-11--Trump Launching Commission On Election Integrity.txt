After the election, President Donald Trump claimed that he lost the popular vote because millions voted illegally.

He said that he would launch an investigation into the voter fraud.

Donald Trump is expected to launch a commission on “election integrity” Thursday, following up on his unsubstantiated claim that three to five million people voted illegally in the last presidential election. The president will sign an executive order directing the commission to review alleged voter fraud and voter suppression in the U.S. voting system. Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach will head the commission.

What will the commission do?

“The Commission will review policies and practices that enhance or undermine the American people’s confidence in the integrity of Federal elections,” an official told The Daily Caller on background. “This will include reviewing laws and activities that lead to improper registrations, improper voting, fraudulent registrations, fraudulent voting, and voting suppression.”

The commission is supposed to issue a report on their findings next year.

In January, he had raised concerns about people who vote in multiple states, illegal aliens and dead people voting.

The aim of the commission would be to strengthen the procedures for voting.

Obvious things that need focusing on: voter ID and stopping non-citizen voting mistakenly or on purpose.

Democrats are already flipping out calling it voter suppression.

Makes one wonder: why would they be so concerned about actually ensuring that only legally proper voters are in fact voting?

Sounds like they’re quaking in their boots…
