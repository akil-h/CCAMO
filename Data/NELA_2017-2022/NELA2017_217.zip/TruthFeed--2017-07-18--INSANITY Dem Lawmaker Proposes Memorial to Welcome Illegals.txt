You will not believe what this Democrat lawmaker wants to do at the Southern Border.

Rep. José Serrano wants to turn the Southern Border into “Ellis Island” by erecting another “Statue of Liberty” on the border to welcome illegals.

Democrats care nothing for the safety of the American people.

Liberals don’t care about the drugs, gangs, sex trafficking and illegal weapons that flood across the border.

All they care about is creating a new army of Democrat voters.
