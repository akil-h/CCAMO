Considering the field that Megyn Kelly is in, one would think she would be critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the other hand, his critics are often murdered, especially journalists. Conservatives don’t seem to have a problem with the Russian leader, often times during former President Barack Obama’s time in office, they praised Putin while slamming Trump’s predecessor. Donald Trump has repeatedly praised Putin, even to the point of defending the Russian President for murdering journalists. Trump did that at least twice.

Kelly, the former Fox News host who is not besties with Trump, said that Putin was “very personable” when the cameras were off during her exclusive interview on NBC News with the Russian leader.

“I’m glad an autocratic murdering despot was nice to you, @megynkelly… cool beans…,” one Twitter user said.

“Thugs can be personable. Focus, Blondie,” another Twitter user wrote.

Such a “charming fellow” that Putin is.

The added bonus is that he didn’t murder anyone.

Putin tried to defend his earlier remarks to Kelly in which he claimed that “patriotic” hackers could have interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Putin insisted that the hackers could have come from “anywhere” and then they could have shifted the blame to make it look like Russia was behind the hacking.

Trump, Russia’s pick for president, openly called for Russians to hack Hillary Clinton’s email account. “I will tell you this, Russia: If you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” Trump said at a news conference in Florida at the time. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”

We’re sure it’s all just a coinky dink, though.
