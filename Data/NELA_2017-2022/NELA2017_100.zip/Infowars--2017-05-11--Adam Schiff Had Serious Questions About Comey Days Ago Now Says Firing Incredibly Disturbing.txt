Representative Adam Schiff said he had “serious questions” about James Comey’s judgement just days ago, but is now trying to claim his firing is “incredibly disturbing.”

Schiff who serves as the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence called the firing of Comey, “incredibly disturbing,” during an interview on Tuesday. “It just harkens back, I think, to some of those most tainted actions by President Nixon,” Schiff went on to say.

However, less than a week ago while appearing on MSNBC, Schiff was asked if he had confidence in FBI Director James Comey. “Well, you know, my answer, as you can gather, is I have serious questions about the judgment that he exercised last year. I have to hope that he’s going to do better with this investigation,” Schiff told MSNBC’s, Chris Hayes.

Schiff went on to tell Hayes, “I do think there are substantial questions that were raised about his handling of these investigations last year, and I have to hope that he’s going to do a better job in the future.”

Senator Chuck Schumer had a similar flip-flop in the span of five hours.

On Wednesday morning, Schumer called for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump camp’s Russia ties, only to completely reverse himself hours later and insist Rosenstein not be allowed to appoint a special prosecutor and instead hand the task to “the highest-serving career civil servant at the Department of Justice.”

According to reports, Trump thought Comey’s firing would be taken positively by both sides. While news of the firing made Stephen Colbert’s liberal audience cheer with glee, little did he know the media and Democrats would decide, “Wtf, I love Comey now,” and manage to manufacture a fake scandal out of it.
