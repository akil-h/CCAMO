President Trump and First Lady Melania descended Air Force One in Saudi Arabia’s capital city of Riyadh on Saturday morning, and as usual, the mainstream media is falling all over themselves to report the best criticisms they can come up with.

Funny enough, the widespread obsession with critiquing the President has the media missing the real story on this one.

Women are expected to cover their heads as part of the hijab requirement of the Saudi Arabian government, but Melania forewent the covering over the weekend, as have many female world leaders in the past.

Looking incredible, as always.

Naturally, liberals are up in arms over one of Trump’s tweets from back in 2015, when he criticized then-First Lady Michelle Obama for making the same choice to forego a headscarf on a Saudi Arabia visit.

But once again, because the leftist media is hung up on the President’s tweets from years before his presidency, they’re missing the real story—the Saudi Arabian King shook Melania’s hand.

The Quran forbids Muslim men from shaking hands with women.

And Muslims are kinda pissed about it.

But why question the leader of a nation that’s formally oppressive to women when you could criticize the leader of the free world instead?
