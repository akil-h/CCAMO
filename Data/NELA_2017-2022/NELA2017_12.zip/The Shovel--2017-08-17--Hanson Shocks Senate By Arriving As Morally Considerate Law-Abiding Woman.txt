Pauline Hanson caused waves in the Senate again today by arriving in Question Time dressed up as a law abiding practicing Muslim.

Hanson, who usually arrives to Question Time dressed as a racist, made an uncharacteristic statement when she sat in her chamber seat pretending to be a person who cares about morality.

The One Nation Senator has a history of speaking out against the burqa, but until now has not responded to pleas from other Australians to hide her face. Unfortunately for those present she later revealed her face.

It is understood things will be back to normal tomorrow, with Ms Hanson expected to arrive dressed as a racist arsehole.
