LOS ANGELES – Hulu’s celebrated production of the Handmaid’s Tale won big at the news & documentary Emmy awards last night. Despite tough competition, the show took home the coveted Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series award.

“This harrowing documentary series gives us an insightful look into the White House and the current state of America,” said Emmy voter Pierce Hendricks. “We could not believe the documentarians were able to get the footage of Mar-a-Lago they did, but I guess just by changing the name to Gilead they were able to fool the administration.”

The Handmaid’s Tale is filled with compelling glimpses into ordinary American life: from rising infertility and protests turning violent, to men being torn limb-from-limb by mobs of disenfranchised women in bonnets.

Other top nominees this year include documentary series the Man in the High Castle (which follows the rise of the alt-right movement), news series American Horror Story, and a sixty-minute video of the American flag on fire.

Sources confirmed one direct connection between the White House and the series: the Handmaids’ iconic red dresses are sourced from Ivanka Trump’s latest clothing line, featuring a new style of headwear known as the “Complicite Bonnet”, now available at The Bay locations across Canada.
