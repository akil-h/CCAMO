Early Wednesday morning students at Grambling State University in Lousiana were asked to stay inside after an individual shot and killed two people on campus. The suspect is still at large.

Though the school was not placed on lockdown, they were asked to stay inside as the suspect is still at large after fleeing the scene. Police do not believe he was a student and believe a fight preceded the shooting. The police are looking for tips tp lead to the capture.

The slain were Earl Andrews and Monquiarious Caldwell. Caldwell was not a student at GSU; however, Andrews was a senior.

Will Sutton, the Grambling State University Director of University Communications, issued this statement:

‘This is a horrible tragedy. Nothing that anybody would’ve ever wanted to have happened. Our prayers are with the victims and their families. There’s no place for violence on Grambling State University campus. We always encourage our students to be safe, to be aware, watch who they hang out with, and watch who’s around at all times. This is a most unfortunate situation.’
