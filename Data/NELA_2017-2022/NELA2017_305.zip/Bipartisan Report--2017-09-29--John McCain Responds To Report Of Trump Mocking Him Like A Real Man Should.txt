Earlier this week, reports surfaced about Trump wandering around the White House and impersonating members of the Senate, particularly Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) and Senator John McCain (R-Arizona). White House insiders said that Trump imitated McConnell’s “slumped shoulders [and] lethargic body language,” and mocked the thumbs-down that McCain gave when he voted “no” on the bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Trump’s imitation of McCain was especially controversial, as McCain suffers from limited mobility in his arms as a result of the way he was treated when he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Many people pointed this fact out after the story about Trump’s actions broke and criticized him for — once again — mocking someone with a disability.

On Thursday, a reporter from The Hill reached out to McCain and asked him what he thinks about Trump’s alleged behavior. McCain was rather nonchalant in his response, saying that there’s nothing he can do about the president’s childish antics.

McCain also said that he represents the state of Arizona and “they know me.”

McCain’s subdued response to Trump’s latest insult is similar to the statement he made just a few days ago, when he revealed during an interview with 60 Minutes’ Lesley Stahl that Trump has never apologized for mocking him two years ago for having been captured and detained in Vietnam.

During a rally in 2015, Trump said about McCain:

McCain disputed claims that he voted against the repeal of the ACA because he was trying to get back at Trump for not apologizing, and then added:

‘If I took offense at everybody who has said something about me, or disparaged me or something like that — life is too short. You’ve got to move on. And on an issue of this importance to the nation, for me to worry about a personal relationship, then I’m not doing my job.’
