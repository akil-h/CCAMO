CNN has never been prone to taking the near continuous stream of insults from the president lightly. Yet again, on Monday morning, President Trump, who is currently in the middle of a seventeen day vacation at his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, tweeted angrily about the supposedly “fake news.” Coupled with his latest tweets are a series of videos that have popped up recently on Trump’s Facebook page, featuring figures including Lara Trump and former CNN commentator Kayleigh McEnany sharing what they call the “real news.”

CNN’s Jake Tapper responded to all of this in his show Monday, slamming the president for being committed far more to his own personal opinions than to facts in his seemingly never ending quest to vanquish “fake news.”

Tapper began by tearing apart the “real news” that the president himself peddled on Twitter this Monday morning, where he claimed that despite the “24/7 Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES & WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger!”

As the veteran CNN anchor went on to say of Trump’s usage of the term “fake news”:

‘Almost every single time he’s used that term, the news has been accurate. It’s just been news he doesn’t like. You can start with his — I think — very first usage of the term — that CNN scoop, that intelligence chiefs, specifically the then-FBI Director briefed then-President elect Trump on the existence of that dossier which had made unsubstantiated claims about leverage that the Russians claimed to have had on the president-elect.’

Tapper, after giving other examples of where Trump’s claims of “fake news” have diverged from reality, slammed the Trump camp’s “real news” that they are peddling in the videos featuring, most recently, McEnany, saying:
