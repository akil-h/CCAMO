We all know that by now.

It won’t surprise you to hear that Mikey said something dumb on Twitter again.

However, that’s not what’s interesting about his latest tweet.

What’s remarkable is Moore’s ability to take something not racist and turn it into something racist to fit into his liberal narrative.

O.J. Simpson was released from prison today in Nevada after serving 9 years for armed robbery.

Moore was all over it with something dumb to say.

It takes a very talented racist to be able to blame absolutely everything on racism.

I’m really starting to feel bad for Michael Moore. This is just embarrassing at this point. How do you get out of bed each day being this obsessed with race?
