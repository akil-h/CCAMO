President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, reportedly advocated an "attack" response style over a more measured reaction in a White House huddle on Wednesday, according to a new report.

The meeting followed the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel in charge of the Department of Justice investigation into Russian election meddling and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. It resulted in conflicting messages issued by the White House in response to the appointment.

After Trump learned Mueller's appointment, the president called in staff members including Kushner, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, communications director Michael Dubke, chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Stephen Bannon, The New York Times reported.

While most of the people encouraged the president to issue a statement accepting the decision of the deputy attorney general, Kushner didn't agree, two senior administration officials told the Times.

Instead, Kushner pushed for the president to counterattack.

The White House then released a statement late on Wednesday voicing confidence that the newly appointed special counsel leading the federal investigation would find no collusion between Trump's campaign and Moscow.

“A thorough investigation will confirm what we already know — there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,” Trump said in the Wednesday statement. “I look forward to this matter concluding quickly.”

“This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!” Trump tweeted.
