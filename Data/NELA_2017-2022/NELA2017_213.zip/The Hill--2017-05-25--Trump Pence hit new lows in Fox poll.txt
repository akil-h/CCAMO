President Trump and Vice President Pence are facing their lowest approval ratings since the inauguration, according to a new Fox News poll.

More than half of voters, 53 percent, disapprove of the job Trump is doing, compared to just 40 percent who approve. Pence's numbers are slightly higher, with a 42 percent approval rating and 43 percent disapproving.

Those numbers are a significant drop from their ratings in a similar Fox News poll last month. It found that 45 percent of voters approved of Trump's job performance, and 50 percent approved of Pence's.

The approval numbers mirror how voters feel about the House GOP's latest effort to repeal ObamaCare, the poll shows. Forty percent of Americans approve of the Republican effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, while 53 percent are opposed. More than half of all voters, 53 percent, also said ObamaCare has so far been a net benefit for the country.

Pollsters also found that despite the news media's focus on the investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, voters are most strongly concerned about government spending, with 80 percent saying they were very concerned. Other top issues included infrastructure repair, North Korea and the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

The Fox News poll of 1,011 voters was conducted from May 21 to 23. It has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
