Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg got some tragic news this week when she learned that pressure is mounting for her to recuse herself from the upcoming case on Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban order given her open dislike of the president.

Western Journalism reported that the Supreme Court has set Monday, June 12 as the deadline for anyone who wishes to challenge the travel ban to submit their responses. Ginsburg has openly bashed Trump frequently in the media, beginning last summer.

“He is a faker. He has no consistency about him,” she told CNN last July. “He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns?”

When asked how the Supreme Court would be impacted by a Trump presidency, Ginsburg said, “I don’t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs.”

“I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president,” she later added.

Attorney David Weisberg wrote an op-ed published on Monday saying that the Code of Conduct makes it clear that Ginsburg must recuse herself from the travel ban case based on the comments she made about Trump. The code clearly states that a judge must not “publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.”

Gregg Jarrett agreed in a piece for Fox News, saying that federal law requires “[a]ny justice …shall disqualify himself [or herself] in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. He shall also disqualify himself … where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.”
