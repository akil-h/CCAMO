Donald Trump NEVER takes it easy and always has something MAJOR to tell the world. Last night, the President of the United States went on FOX

Last night, the President of the United States went on FOX Business and dropped a bombshell that should remind EVERYONE of the horrors we saw with the Clintons…

“I want to give everybody a good fair chance. Director Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton. That I can tell you. If he weren’t, she would be going to trial.”

He went on to explain EXACTLY what he meant,

“Don’t forget when Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton.”

“People don’t realize that. He saved her life. Because I call it ‘Comey won.’ And I joke about it a little bit. When he was reading those charges, she was guilty of every charge. And then he said she was essentially ok.”

OH SHOOT! He is 100% right. If it were not for James Comey clearing all of Hillary’s charges, she would be on trial right now. She broke so many laws it’s NUTS!

So let’s help make sure President Trump’s reminder reaches all the right people by helping it go VIRAL on the internet. And while we are at it, leave a prayer for the President,

Dear God, please help keep President Trump safe. He is working hard to fix our country and many people wish horrible things on him. Please protect and guide him with Your infinite wisdom.
