At least 10 people were killed and 50 people were injured Monday following explosions in St. Petersburg’s subway system, Russian state-run media outlet TASS reported.

CBS News reported that two explosions took place in two subway stations in St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city.

Reuters reported that the Russian news agency Interfax “quoted an unnamed source as saying one of the blasts was caused by a bomb filled with shrapnel.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was in St. Petersburg on Monday, said officials are investigating if the explosions were the result of a terrorist attack, the Associated Press reported. Putin also offered condolences to the families of the victims.

Reuters said that Russian officials have closed the St. Petersburg subway following the explosions, while Moscow is “taking unspecified additional security measures” for its subway system “in case of an attack there.”
