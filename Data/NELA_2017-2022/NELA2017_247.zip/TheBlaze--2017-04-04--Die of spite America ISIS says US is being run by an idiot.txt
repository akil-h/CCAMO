A spokesman for the Islamic State terrorist group mocked President Donald Trump in a statement Tuesday, saying that the United States is “being run by an idiot,” according to Reuters.

The remarks by spokesman Abi al-Hassan al-Muhajer — delivered in a recording on the messaging network Telegram — marks the group’s first official statement about Trump since he took office in January, Reuters reported.

In the recording, al-Muhajer said:

America you have drowned and there is no savior, and you have become prey for the soldiers of the caliphate in every part of the earth, you are bankrupt and the signs of your demise are evident to every eye.

“There is no more evidence than the fact that you are being run by an idiot who does not know what Syria or Iraq or Islam is,” he said. “Die of spite, America, die of spite, a nation where both young and old are racing to die in the name of God will not be defeated.”

Reuters noted that Trump has vowed to defeat the terrorist group and that his administration is “examining ways to accelerate the U.S.-led coalition campaign that U.S. and Iraqi officials say has so far been largely successful in uprooting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.”
