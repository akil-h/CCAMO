WASHINGTON, D.C. – A roll of paper towels signed by President Donald J. Trump during his recent visit to hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico has sold on eBay for nearly $95, the item’s seller, Jim Gaines, told the New York Post.

Gaines, who was in the crowd during President Trump’s brief visit to a relief center in Puerto Rico last week, said he “leaped into the air” to catch a roll of two-ply paper towels tossed by the Commander-in-Chief. “It was exhilarating, you feel like a thirteen year-old girl at a rock concert,” Gaines told the Post before adding that he fought “tooth and nail” to reach the front of the crowd in order to obtain an autograph from the president.

The twenty-six year-old Gaines, who serves as an aide to White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, said he originally intended to keep the signed roll of paper towels as a memento but changed his mind after several colleagues urged him to sell it on eBay. “I listed it as a novelty item and set a starting bid of five dollars,” Gains explained, continuing, “I honestly didn’t think anyone would even see it.”

However, much to the surprise of Gaines and his colleagues at the White House, the listing quickly ignited what would become a tense three-day bidding war between a half-dozen hopeful buyers. “We were shocked at how quickly it took off,” said Gaines. “An hour into the auction it’s already at eight dollars. Then it jumps to nine-fifty, then ten-twenty-five, eleven; it just kept going up.”

By the auction’s closing, the highly coveted two-ply roll of paper towels signed by none other than President Donald Trump himself netted Gaines a whopping $94.86. “I never expected to get anywhere close to this much,” he admitted. As to what he intends to do with his winnings, Gaines told the Post the money has already been put towards a good cause. “We’re throwing a little office soiree later in the week,” said Gaines, adding, “I used the cash to pick up a few bottles of Puerto Rican rum.”
