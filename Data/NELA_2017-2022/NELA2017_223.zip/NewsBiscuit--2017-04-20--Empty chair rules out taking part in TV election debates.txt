An empty chair has confirmed that it will not take part in planned TV debates ahead of the general election. The chair told the BBC today that instead it preferred to be out and about ‘pressing the flesh’ with voters.

The chair, an oak and beige fabric bar stool, has been heavily criticised by party leaders who have accused it of dodging a head-to-head showdown. Meanwhile Prime Minister Theresa May has threatened to appear in the chair’s place if it does not take part, a move opposed by many amid concerns that there’s too much politics going on nowadays.

‘The TV debates are all about giving the party leaders the chance to get their policies across to the voting public,’ said BBC producer Fenton Barnes. ‘But it’s also about entertainment and putting bums on seats. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to put bums on seats if the seats won’t take part’.

However, the chair’s refusal to participate does not appear to have had a negative impact on its popularity as a fresh YouGov poll indicated that 72% of voters said the chair would make a more effective prime minister than Jeremy Corbyn.
