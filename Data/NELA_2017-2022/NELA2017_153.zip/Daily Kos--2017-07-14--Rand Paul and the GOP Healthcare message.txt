Surprise quote: "And it has a nearly $200 billion insurance bailout superfund, and I want to know when it became the Republican position to be for a bailout of a multi-billion-dollar private industry? I'm just not for that. I'm not for giving a penny of taxpayer money to a billion-dollar insurance industry." - Rand Paul

Sarcastic paraphrase of Rand Paulâ€™s voting record: "But I will give taxpayer money to a multi-billion-dollar oil corporation, or a multi-billion-dollar farming conglomerate, or a multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical company, or a multi-billion-dollar bank... because that's different."
