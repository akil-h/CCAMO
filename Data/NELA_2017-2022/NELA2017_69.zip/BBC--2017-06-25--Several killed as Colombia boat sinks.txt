At least three people died when a passenger boat sank on a reservoir in north-western Colombia, police say.

Dozens of people are missing after the four-deck vessel went down near the tourist town of Guatapé, 45km (28 miles) east of Medellín on Sunday.

There were about 150 people board. The boat sank in less than five minutes, eyewitness Juan Quiroz told the BBC.

Leisure boats quickly came to the rescue, hauling victims from the water and the top deck of the vessel.

An air force helicopter has been sent to the area to assess the situation.

"The situation looks serious," a local government official told AFP news agency.

More than 20 people were taken to a hospital in Guatapé.

There are no details yet on why the boat sank.
