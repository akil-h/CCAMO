Model Sarah Kohan brought some serious heat Monday night, but it’s pretty par for the course from her account.

Kohan hit her fans with a shot of herself in a black bikini and the caption, “99 problems however this beach ain’t one.”

I agree, Sarah. I wholeheartedly agree that you never had a problem when you’re on the beach. Of course, the last time I was on a beach it was in Puerto Rico, and I wouldn’t even take my shirt off. The drinks were great though. Like I said, the beach is always a great time.

Happy too see Kohan and I agree on something. Naturally, we’re all happy to see her embrace team-bikini instead of that one-piece garbage. Well done. (72 Times Sara Underwood Went Topless)
