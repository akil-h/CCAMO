A certain low-grade satirist is upset that no fewer than ten edgy satire outlets have stolen his Scaramucci joke.

Bigoted, disrespectful moron One Tongue Johnny wantonly abused his freedom of speech privileges by screaming:

Oo! Oh Pompeo; will they never let me go? I’ve been victimized by the Trump family

In the middle of writing his edgy Glossy News satire piece, OTJ was highly disturbed to discover that before he had even laid down the penultimate stroke of his pen, a number of edgy news outlets had stolen precisely the same joke.

Bejasus now, well if it isn’t our One Tongue Johnny! Sure that there’s tara, so it is! Our One Tongue Johnny had great craic scribin’ this here, now, but if the feckin’ rival satire eejits aren’t claimin’ for to have writ it first!

Newsthump were among the worst offenders.

He screamed, as he chained himself to the railings.

… Psst! Here’s the real Bohemian rhapsody, for those who have been living under a rock for the past few decades. The original is always the best ‘un! That there’s right now, so it is! Baet on!
