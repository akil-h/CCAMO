ALEX MARLOW (HOST): Right, and Twitter has made announcements, they're going to be making massive crackdowns voluntarily on hate speech, and they've made a calculation that their business model is to be a site that regulates speech, that infringes on free speech, and not a site that is a promoter of free speech. And this is something that -- I think it’s extremely anti-American, and it's really something that we're seeing more commonly in China. So it's an interesting development that we're seeing throughout the world as the world grapples with mean online commenters, which is, again -- I -- we've come a long way, John, from "sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me," to now we have Twitter cracking down on free speech and The New York Times praising China for doing the same.
