JAKE TAPPER (HOST): Though the original protests are about race, and the protesters were almost entirely black, and the team owners whom the president was calling upon to fire or suspend those players are almost entirely white, and the president chose to launch this campaign in front of an almost all white crowd in front in Alabama -- despite all that, the president insisted that this has nothing to do with race.

It is 100 percent true that the president never said anything about race. He did not have to, this entire discussion is about black men protesting racial injustice. One of course wonders why in the president's view a black man protesting racial injustice by kneeling during the anthem is a "son of a bitch," while whites marching along Nazis and the Klan to protest the removal of a statue of a Confederate general is a, quote, "very fine person," but I digress.
