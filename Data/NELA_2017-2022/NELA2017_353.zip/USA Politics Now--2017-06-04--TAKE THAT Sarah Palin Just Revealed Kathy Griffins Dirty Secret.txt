Kathy Griffin has a sick penchant for going after children in her “comedy” routines. Now Sarah Palin is speaking out against Griffin, and reminding the world her dirty secret:

Last year, Griffin said that she would “beat down” Barron Trump. And before that, Griffin targeted Sarah Palin’s own young daughters.

Palin stated she, Melania, and other mothers have “tried to protect our children from Kathy’s soulless vile attacks.”

In 2011 Kathy Griffin did an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in which she said:

“I’ve already gone for Sarah, Todd and Bristol obviously. But I think it’s Willow’s year to go down. In 2011, I want to offend a new Palin.”

Willow Palin was 16 years old at the time.

In 2010 Griffin paid a personal visit to Palin’s home and interviewed the father of Bristol Palin’s child in order to taunt the Alaska Governor’s family.

Palin wrote of the incident, “When this ‘celebrity’ (who ‘celebrates’ her, btw?) traveled all the way to Wasilla and actually knocked on my home’s door to personally humiliate my kids again, I knew she was deranged.”

Although Kathy Griffin’s recent photoshoot in which she pretended to behead the president was extremely disturbing, it seems like it is totally in line with the character she’s shown over the years.
