Salman Khan is on a winning spree. After starring in back-to-back blockbusters like Kick, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and Sultan, he is here yet again to enthrall his fans with Tubelight. The trailer has been launched and has taken the country into its grip. fans are worried that this will be a story based film, something Salman movies are not known for. In fact Kabir Khan had to hold a press conference to clarify the issue.

Off late Salman movies are purely based on his personal charisma, and any story is smaller than the man himself. So when people saw the tubelight trailer, they were shocked, as they found some traits of a story here. Story and Salman movies never work together.

Kabir Khan took notice of this trend and immediately called a press conference. Kabir assured fans that the movie will be a normal Salman movie with dance, songs, actions and no connection with a script. He conveyed that trailers have to be made good as the western audience is very demanding, unlike the Salman fans. He also added that his team had spent no time on the script and even the dialogues were written on the sets.

Faking News reporter spoke to one such fan named Sneha Anand and she had this to say,” I like Salman’s movies because I don’t have to apply my mind in understanding the story. In fact I hated Sultan, so much so that I warned my husband to not take me to such crap movies. Salman’s best movies are the Readys, the Bodyguards and the Kicks. I hope Kabir Khan is speaking the truth and Tubelight, the movie, doesn’t turn out to be as interesting as the trailer.”

The movie is scheduled to release on 23rd of June and the first 2-3 days collections will show us if Kabir is right or not.
