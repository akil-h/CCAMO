The news doesn’t need to be complicated and confusing; that’s what any new release from Microsoft is for. And, as in the case with anything from Microsoft, to keep the news from worrying our pretty little heads over, remember something new and equally indecipherable will come out soon.

Really all you need to do is follow one simple rule: barely pay attention and jump to conclusions. So, here are some headlines today and my first thoughts:

Nothing says ‘White Supremacy’ like Tiki torches made in China.

Y’know the world has jumped the shark when the only person able to stop a nuclear war is Dennis Rodman.

No word if any of the candidates had to prove they weren’t born in Hawaii.

Soon to be seen on Dickieleaks.

And, then forgot where it was…

This is like that fable between ‘The Tortoise and The Hair.’

Any older and we’re gonna start calling it ‘Broken Hip Hop.’

I’ll get to commenting about that whenever.

In fairness, Hatch was around during Civil War.

Damn it, I already miss Scaramucci. I think I’m suffering from ‘Do the Fandango Joke Withdrawal.’

Although, I’m betting she works with a lot of Latin guys with that name.

Seems it’s mostly pics of Mike Pence measuring for drapes in Oval Office

One of the good things about aging is you probably forgot all about ‘Ishtar.’

Seems he’s in violation of several statutes in the penile code.

In fairness, it sounded OK when Putin dictated it to him.
