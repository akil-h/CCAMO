ANTIFA thug try to kill woman during siege, eyewitness says

NEW ORLEANS (INTELLIHUB) — Deputy mayor Ryan Berni was riding shotgun with ANTIFA during their siege of the Jefferson Monument last Monday and stood down along with police as people were being assaulted by a group of approximately 270 rock throwing ANTIFA thugs, eyewitnesses say.

“The cops only got involved once we started fighting back,” an anti-ANTIFA protester said.

According to one witness, a woman who was wearing a “stab-proof vest” ended up getting slashed in the thigh by ANTIFA thugs who were “trying to kill her.”
