Trump spoke to the people of Poland, and the message that he delivered to them was that being invaded by Nazis and Soviets was “trouble and tough.”

Trump said, “In 1920, in the Miracle of Vistula, Poland stopped the Soviet army bent on European conquest. Then, 19 years later in 1939, you were invaded yet again, this time by Nazi Germany from the west and the Soviet Union from the east. That’s trouble. That’s tough.”

The President who is under federal investigation because his presidential campaign may have colluded with the Russians to undermine democracy warned that the West is in danger, “Our own fight for the West does not begin on the battlefield — it begins with our minds, our wills, and our souls. Today, the ties that unite our civilization are no less vital, and demand no less defense, than that bare shred of land on which the hope of Poland once totally rested. Our freedom, our civilization, and our survival depend on these bonds of history, culture, and memory.”

The fight for the West also begins with stopping a president who may have collaborated with Putin to undermine US democracy.

Trump’s schtick doesn’t play well on the world stage. As the issues get bigger, Donald Trump’s mind gets exposed as smaller. Anytime this president speaks, there is a more than 50/50 possibility of some type of embarrassment resulting from his words.

Donald Trump is a small man who can’t lead on the big stage. Trump is a damaged president with no credibility, little knowledge, and a cloud of scandal hanging over his head. He can’t do the job as president, and every time he tries, Trump reveals why he is failing at home and abroad.
