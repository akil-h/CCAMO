Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) spent eight years doing nothing but criticizing and complaining about former President Obama’s global leadership, but when asked if American leadership was better under Obama, McCain admitted that it was.

The Guardian reported:

 Senator John McCain, a prominent Republican voice on foreign policy, was visibly irked when asked by the Guardian what message Trump had sent to the United Kingdom, one of America’s most enduring allies.

“What do you think the message is? The message is that America doesn’t want to lead,” McCain said, while adding of the rest of the world: “They are not sure of American leadership, whether it be in Siberia or whether it be in Antarctica.”

Asked if America’s standing on the global stage was better under Barack Obama, McCain, a fervent critic of the previous administration’s foreign policy, responded: “As far as American leadership is concerned, yes.”

McCain seemed perpetually bitter that he lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama. For eight years, there was nothing too small for McCain to criticize Obama for, so imagine the shock when the Arizona Senator who couldn’t put together a lucid question during the Comey hearing spoke the truth about the damage that Trump is doing to US global leadership.

It is obvious to anyone that is paying attention that Donald Trump has weakened America’s standing in the world. Trump’s primary goal appears to be to make sure that the United States is no longer a world superpower. Trump is fracturing alliances that go back to the post-WWII period while withdrawing the US from the global community.

Before Donald Trump took office, America was the world’s leader, but things have gotten so bad so quickly, that even John McCain is admitting that the country was better off under Obama.
