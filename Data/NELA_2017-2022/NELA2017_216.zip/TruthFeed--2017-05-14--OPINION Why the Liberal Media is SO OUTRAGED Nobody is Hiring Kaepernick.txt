OPINION : Why the Liberal Media is SO OUTRAGED Nobody is Hiring Kaepernick

Everywhere you look, there is another liberal journalist COMPLAINING that Colin Kaepernick has not been hired yet.

Why is there so much incessant whining about a player who is past his prime and had a 1 and 10 record last year?

The vast majority of the mainstream media is overwhelmingly made up of bleeding heart liberals.

96% of media donations went to Hillary Clinton compared to only 4% for Donald Trump.

They are made up of people …. just like Colin Kaepernick.

What these liberal journalists hate about Kaepernick not getting hired is it shows how the real world works and team owners taking behavior into account.

Liberals want to complain all day, whine about “social justice,” play the victim card even when they are not victims, and at the end of the day, they expect the rest of society to just “deal with it.”

When their ass-hatting, toddler-like behavior, such as kneeling during the national anthem is met with negative consequences, it TERRIFIES them.

So the next time you read a liberal media piece outraged over Kaepernick not being hired, you know the truth.

The author is a complaining liberal like Kaepernick and hates the idea of getting punished in the real world for it.
