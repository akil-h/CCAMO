BREAKING : Trump Mocks Dems After Yet Another Special Election Loss

President Trump hit the Democrats hard after their embarrassing loss in Georgia.

Trump points out that if Democrats worked more with Republicans in Congress, then perhaps that might help their chances.

Most likely, Democrats will continue to oppose Trump and continue to LOSE.

The Democratic Party has become out of touch with average Americans voters, and has alienated the majority of the country with their embrace of radical left-wing positions.

President Trump slammed the Democratic Party Wednesday morning for what he described as a failure to work with Republicans in Congress.

“Democrats would do much better as a party if they got together with Republicans on Healthcare,Tax Cuts,Security. Obstruction doesn’t work!” Trump tweeted.

On a policy front, Democrats and even some Senate Republicans have complained in recent weeks about the secrecy of changes being made to a healthcare reform bill by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office.

A draft of the bill is expected to be released Thursday morning.

Trump late Tuesday also mocked Democrats for losing five special elections since he was elected president.
