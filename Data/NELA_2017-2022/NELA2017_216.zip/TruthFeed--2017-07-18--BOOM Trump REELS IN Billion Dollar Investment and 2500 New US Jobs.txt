BOOM! Trump REELS IN Billion Dollar Investment and 2,500 New U.S. Jobs

India’s Mahindra Ltd. plans on doubling their investment in the U.S. based on the economy under President Trump.

President Trump is keeping his campaign promises of bringing JOBS and manufacturing, and prosperity back home.

This is President Trump’s America First agenda AT WORK!

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. EQM&M 0.66% plans to double its bets in the U.S. over the next five years, spending $1 billion in an effort to strengthen the Indian company’s brand as President Donald Trump pressures companies foreign and domestic to steer investments toward America.

“We believe in America,” Chairman Anand Mahindra said Monday during a discussion with reporters and a separate interview with The Wall Street Journal in Midtown Manhattan. He played down Mr. Trump’s rhetoric on trade, investment and immigration, pointing to encouraging business conditions in the U.S.“For the moment, the cycle seems to be very much in favor” of a robust U.S. economy, Mr. Mahindra said. He added that he is “not the expert” on whether attractive economic conditions resulted from previous Obama administration policies or the current White House. Mahindra’s plan, which builds on $1 billion invested in the U.S. to date, would double the company’s American employment to roughly 5,000 people, executives said. The Mumbai-based conglomerate, which executives refer to as a federation of independently run businesses, manufactures sport-utility vehicles and faces competition in its home market from established auto makers rushing to India.
