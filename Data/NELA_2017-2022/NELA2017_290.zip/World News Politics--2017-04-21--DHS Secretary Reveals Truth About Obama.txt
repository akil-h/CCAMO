The Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly spoke on how Obama’s lackadaisical border security made America more dangerous. He described the biggest threat to America “transnational criminal organizations”.

“There is no better argument for secure borders than TCOs. And since the first week of President Trump’s administration, we have been actively securing our borders and enforcing our immigration laws. Not only is this our right as a sovereign nation—it is our responsibility to ensure the safety of the American public,” said Kelly.

“People who illegally cross our borders do not respect the laws of our nation. We want to get the law breakers off our streets, and out of the country, for the good of our communities,” he said.

He reviewed how since Trump was sworn in as President the number of illegal aliens coming into our country has plummeted significantly. “But make no mistake—we are a nation under attack. We are under attack from criminals who think their greed justifies raping young girls at knifepoint, dealing poison to our youth, or killing just for fun,” said Kelly.

“We are under attack from people who hate us, hate our freedoms, hate our laws, hate our values, hate the way we simply live our lives. We are under attack from failed states, cyber-terrorists, vicious smugglers, and sadistic radicals. And we are under attack every single day. The threats are relentless,” said Kelly.

The Department of Homeland Security is finally opening up about our poor security. This is the same organization under Obama that kept flying in people from the Middle East and constantly defending the terrorism they actively endorsed. The new secretary is taking security seriously. Sealing borders and being active in vetting will secure our nation and protect our children. The future of America is slowly looking better.
