The Black community overwhelming supports the agenda proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

This is especially true of an item DeVos has so made the focal point of her tenure thus far: school choice.

According to the Black Alliance of Educational Options

According to a Beck Research survey, 76% of Blacks support school choice.

Here Gerald Robinson, an American Enterprise Institute scholar and an African American, argues how the Black community can especially benefit from school choice.



One would think that the Black community would embrace DeVos for her support of an educational option so popular with Black parents.

However, this has not been the case.

According to the Tampa Bay Times:

One of the reasons for the DeVos antipathy is that Progressives generally prefer government mandates over free market choices.

This preference is obvious by the progressive positions on Social Security, healthcare, the minimum wage, and so on. And it particularly noticeable in the school choice debate.

Just as the larger progressive movement hates school choice, African American progressives, who are generally behind Black organizations like the Congressional Black Caucus and the NAACP, as well as the Black media, are also fierce opponents of school choice.

Dr. Andre Perry for example warns his readers at The Root

But perhaps the larger reason why there is such opposition to DeVos is Trump Derangement Syndrome, an irrational intolerance for all things associated with Donald Trump.

Of course, Black politicos are welcome to oppose DeVos for any reason they choose.

But as long as DeVos remains an advocate for school choice, as well as for charter schools and Historically Blacks Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), both also very popular among Black parents, the Black politicos should acknowledge that opposing her is also opposing what Blacks consider to be in their best interest and the best interest of their children.
