WASHINGTON — President Trump will dine at the White House on Wednesday night with Congress’s two top Democrats, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, pursuing a bipartisan patina as he heads into the fall legislative season with little to show for his first year in office.

Mr. Schumer, the Senate minority leader, and Ms. Pelosi, the House minority leader, have never dined with the president before, and are the only members of the congressional leadership who will attend, according to two people briefed on the meeting.

Also on hand will be Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Marc Short, the president’s legislative director, and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff.

The meeting was described as a follow-up to one that Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi held in the Oval Office last week with Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, at which Mr. Trump astonished — and undercut — his own advisers by leaping at a deal offered by Democrats to attach a stopgap spending bill and debt-ceiling increase to a package of recovery aid for areas affected by Hurricane Harvey.

On the agenda for Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi is protecting so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States when they were young, as well as shoring up the insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act, according to two other people who were briefed on their plans.

Mr. Trump recently began to wind down the program known as DACA, which provided protection from deportation for roughly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants. But he has been torn about it, and he has made clear he would like a legislative fix.
