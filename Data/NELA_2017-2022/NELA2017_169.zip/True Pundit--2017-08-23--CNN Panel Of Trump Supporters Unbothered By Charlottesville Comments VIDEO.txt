CNN’s latest panel of Trump supporters said they were entirely unbothered by Trump’s comments about the violent protests in Charlottesville.

Trump’s insistence that “both sides” were responsible for violence in Charlottesville upset a lot of the country, including some Republicans in Congress. However, the comments clearly resonated with his base.

CNN’s Tuesday morning panel brought together six Trump supporters, three men and three women.

“How many of you were troubled by the president’s response to the violence in Charlottesville?” host Alisyn Camerota asked.

Not a single member of the panel raised their hand.

“None of you minded how President Trump responded?” Camerota followed up.

A black woman on the panel aggressively shook her head no to Camerota’s question.

CNN has had several different Trump supporter panels on their show throughout the Trump presidency, and they routinely don’t seem to care about the latest Trump scandal that is being perpetuated by the media.
