A man who repeatedly contacted the U.S. Secret Service to threaten President Donald Trump’s life was charged in federal court Tuesday.

James Jackson, a truck driver, was arrested in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, after it was determined he made phone calls to the Secret Service field office in Chicago, Illinois, from Oct. 12 through Oct. 13 using a masked phone number, saying he was going to kill the president, The Detroit News reported.

“Better watch Donald Trump a–, ya b—h. Ya’ll think someone playing with yo dumba–es, I am going to blow white brains out … his [expletive] head,” Jackson reportedly said.
