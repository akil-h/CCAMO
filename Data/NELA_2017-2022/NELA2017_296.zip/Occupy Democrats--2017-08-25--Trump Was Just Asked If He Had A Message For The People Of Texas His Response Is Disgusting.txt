As Hurricane Harvey makes landfall in Texas, officials have warned of “catastrophic” flooding and “life-threatening” winds that could leave areas of South Texas “uninhabitable for weeks or months.”

When President Trump was asked by a reporter for One America News Network what message he had for the people of Texas, his response was as useless as it is tone-deaf.

As Trump boards Marine One for yet another retreat from the White House en route to Camp David, his choice of words – “good luck” – is decidedly avoidant and detached. While Trump has a penchant for poor optics and even worse messaging, today’s misguided comment comes at a time when real leadership is sorely needed.

Other top officials have employed strong, decisive language in response to the storm in order to convey the gravity of the situation.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott said, “My top goal is to be able to make it through this storm in a way in which we lose no lives. Put your life first and your property second.”

Brock Long, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said, “Texas is about to have a very significant disaster… The bottom line message is, right now, if people have not heeded the warning, again, their window to do so is closing. If they refuse to heed the warning, that’s on them.”

But, sure, the “good luck” will go a long way, too.

Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!
