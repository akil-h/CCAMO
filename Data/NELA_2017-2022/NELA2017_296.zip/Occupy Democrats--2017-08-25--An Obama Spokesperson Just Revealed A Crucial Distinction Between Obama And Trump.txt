Donald Trump is either unable or, perhaps more likely, unwilling to separate fact from fiction.

In the past, he’s spewed patently untrue stories from conservative propaganda website Breitbart and absurd conspiracy theory site Infowars, which in the past has peddled stories of extraterrestrial bipedal reptiles infiltrating the government among other such nonsense. Trump has appeared on the Infowars show hosted by Alex Jones in the past.

Tommy Vietor, who worked as a spokesman for the National Security Council under President Obama has weighed in on Trump’s unhealthy media diet. Buzzfeed writer Adrian Carrasquillo posted a text message from Vietor, in which Vietor says that Trump’s staff believes he is “too stupid” to figure out that Infowars is garbage.

The “jockeying” Carrasquillo refers to relates to reports that different factions within the White House have sought to influence the president by giving him specific stories of varying veracity.

While it’s entirely possible that Vietor is right and Trump is simply too stupid to discern the truth, one can’t underestimate the likelihood that Trump is willingly engaging in spreading fake news.

Vietor has been an outspoken critic of the disastrous Trump administration. He runs a popular political podcast called Pod Save America with fellow former Obama employees Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Dan Pfeiffer. Click here to give it a listen.

Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!
