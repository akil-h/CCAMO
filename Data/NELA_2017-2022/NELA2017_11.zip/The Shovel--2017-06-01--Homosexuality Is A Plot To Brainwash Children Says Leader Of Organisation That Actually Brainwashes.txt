A woman who founded an organisation with the explicit objective to ‘take this nation for Jesus’, is concerned homosexuality is a plot to get into the minds of children.

The organisation, which has on its homepage an actual fucking photo of children under the age of five being preached to by adults, failed to see a shred of irony in her comments.

“They’re after our young ones, that’s what they’re after,” she told a radio station yesterday, probably before going off to attend a service where charismatic preachers and pop music are used to entice young people to hand over 10% of their incomes.

She also compared the legalisation of same-sex marriage to Hitler. Not joking.
