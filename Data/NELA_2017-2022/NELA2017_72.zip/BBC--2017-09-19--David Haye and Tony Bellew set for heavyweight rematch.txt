David Haye says he has agreed terms for a heavyweight rematch with Tony Bellew.

After a fiery pre-fight build-up, WBC cruiserweight world champion Bellew stopped his rival in the 11th round in their first meeting in March.

Haye injured an Achilles in the sixth round before falling to his third career defeat.

Haye tweeted: "It's taken months of negotiating but teams have finally agreed all terms for Haye-Bellew 2. Will Bellew put pen to paper?"

No date or location has been confirmed by either promoter, but there are reports it will be held on Sunday, 17 December at London's O2 Arena.

Former WBA heavyweight champion Haye needed surgery following the defeat by Liverpool's Bellew, and has since split with trainer Shane McGuigan.

Since splitting with McGuigan, Haye has linked up with renowned Cuban coach Ismael Salas, a trainer of multiple world champions. But the impact of that new relationship will form just a small part of the questions the Hayemaker must answer in a second meeting with Bellew.

Crucially, how much trust will he be able to place in his Achilles? Can he box at full throttle?

Many believed he would have gone on to beat Bellew in March until injury struck but there were signs Haye was beginning to blow prior to his misfortune. Bellew boxed cleverly, countering with accuracy time and again so it is unlikely his chances will be dismissed this time around.

So in the ring this looks balanced on paper and will again deliver plenty of intrigue. It is outside of the ring where many in the sport will hope common sense and calm win the day. Haye was fined for his words last time out, while Bellew faced a stiff warning from the British Boxing Board of Control.

Bellew helped Haye back to his stool in his stricken state afterwards, pointing to a respect. But it is safe to say there is no love lost here and if this bout is confirmed as expected next week, anything other than a ferocious build-up would be a surprise.
