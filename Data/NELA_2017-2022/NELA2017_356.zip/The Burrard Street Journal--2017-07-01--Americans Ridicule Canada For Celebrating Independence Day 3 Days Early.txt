The annual July 1st celebration of Canada Day, has caused widespread confusion south of the border with many Americans questioning why Canadians are celebrating Independence Day 3 days early.

 As Canucks across the world celebrated the 150th birthday of Canada, puzzled Americans took to social media to ridicule their neighbours.

“I think it’s so cute that Canada wants to celebrate our Independence Day too, but wrong day guys!” read one condescending tweet.

“Why are all these people waving flags and celebrating?” wrote another bemused twitter user.  “Have they moved the 4th of July?”

On facebook the hashtag #HappyCanadaDay seemed to cause bafflement in the US, with one woman asking, “Happy Canada day? Ah guys, seriously? It’s Happy AMERICA Day!” Another man with a ‘Make America Great Again’ profile picture posted: “Haha, Canadians are so dumb. Get your own day Canada and quit celebrating ours.”

To add to the confusion, questions were also raised about the Canadian flag being shared on social media. “This is the weirdest looking American flag, I’ve ever seen,” one person commented. “Shouldn’t there be at least 100 stars on it?”

Meanwhile the ever helpful FOX News filmed a short segment to help educate American viewers about Canada Day and it’s origins. However it’s introduction seemed to only further confuse viewers:

“Formerly known as the July 4th pre-party, Canada Day has recently taken on a life of its own, with Canadians now using the day to celebrate their own independence from someone.”

President Trump refused to congratulate Canada on the anniversary and instead tweeted. “Happy America Day. The only thing Canadians should be celebrating is that we haven’t built our wall yet. #MakeCanadaAmericanAgain”
