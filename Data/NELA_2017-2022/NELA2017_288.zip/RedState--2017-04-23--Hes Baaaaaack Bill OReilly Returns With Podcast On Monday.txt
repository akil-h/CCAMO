Since Fox News and Bill O’Reilly parted ways last week many have wondered what the 67-year-old would do now. Write more books? Walking into the sunset and entering a full retirement? Even the idea of the host moving his show to Glenn Beck’s TheBlaze was floated on CNN and even by Beck himself (joking with the caveat that O’Reilly would have to take a massive pay cut.)

But O’Reilly will make his first public statements following his departure from Fox News on his ‘No Spin News’ podcast, according to his website.

The podcast is only available as premium content to paid subscribers of the website. One can be certain that a lot of $4.99 subscriptions will be expensed by news outlets by Monday morning.

The O’Reilly Factor, which had been changed to simply ‘The Factor,’ was shuttered after twenty-one years by Greg Gutfeld on Friday night.

Closing out the show for the last time, Gutfeld said, “How do I turn out the lights on such a venerable and amazing show? I can’t. It’s not my show and it’s not my place. So on behalf of all of us on ‘The Factor,’ good night and godspeed.”

There is no question that Fox News has undergone one of the biggest shake-ups in modern memory, from editorial bent to longtime popular hosts like Megyn Kelly and now O’Reilly leaving by choice or being forced out. Greta Van Susteren left for MSNBC after Roger Ailes was forced out for sexual misconduct last year.

Now the only question is whether O’Reilly can make podcasts popular with his Baby Boomer fan base.
