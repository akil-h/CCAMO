A van has ploughed into crowds on the Ramblas tourist area in Barcelona. The Ramblas are very popular among tourists as a main city centre and walking street.

Spanish police say several people have been injured in a “massive crash”.

The situation is ongoing. onlookers are reporting an “arab looking” man behind the van.

The emergency services are urging people to stay away from the area around Placa Catalunya. More as the story forms.
