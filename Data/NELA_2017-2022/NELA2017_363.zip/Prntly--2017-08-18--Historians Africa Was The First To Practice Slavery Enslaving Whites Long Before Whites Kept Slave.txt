Liberals will squeal at the sound of this, but historians are unanimous; Africa was the first to practice slavery. They also were the last to ban it.

The first society to practice slavery of whites was of course Ancient Egypt, who enslaved the jews and minority caucasian group to serve them in labor. This evolved into a slave trade that spread across Africa and the middle east.

The height of African oppression of whites was in 1551, when African slavers committed what today would be considered genocide against the entire population of the Mediterranean isle of Gozo, enslaving over 5000 men, women, and children.

The Barbers of North Africa terrorised Europe for centuries, leading to the feudal era of Europe where villages crowded around Lords for protection from African raiders.

Ohio State University history Professor Robert Davis describes the White Slave Trade as minimized by most modern historians in his book Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500–1800. Davis estimates that 1 million to 1.25 million white Christian Europeans were enslaved in North Africa, from the beginning of the 16th century to the middle of the 18th, by slave traders from Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli alone (these numbers do not include the European people which were enslaved by Morocco and by other raiders and traders of the Mediterranean Sea coast),[3] and roughly 700 Americans were held captive in this region as slaves between 1785 and 1815.
