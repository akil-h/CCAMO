The widow of a slain American soldier said Monday that President Donald Trump's phone call "upset" her and made her "cry," but the president later disputed the account, calling the conversation "very respectful."

Myeshia Johnson's husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, was one of four Americans killed in Niger earlier this month. Myeshia Johnson said Trump's tone in their phone call last Tuesday made her "angry."

"The president said that 'he knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways.' It made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. He couldn't remember my husband's name," she told ABC's "Good Morning America."
