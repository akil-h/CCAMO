If you're in the military, you're more likely to support President Trump than not, according to a new poll.

The Military Times poll found that 44% of all troops surveyed had a favorable view of the president, compared to 40% who had an unfavorable view.

The views shifted depending on which service members were surveyed, though. While 48% of enlisted troops said they approved of Trump, only 30% of officers held a favorable opinion of the commander-in-chief.

Per the poll, 53% of officers said they had unfavorable views of Trump.

The poll revealed some other divides, as well:

More than 1,100 active-duty troops were surveyed. The poll was conducted prior to the controversy over how Trump has handled phone calls with Gold Star families, including the widow of one of the soldiers who died during the Niger mission this month.

Notably, Trump's overall favorability has barely shifted in the past year, the Military Times reported. It polled service members about their views on Trump in late 2016, after the election. Back then, 46% of troops had a favorable view of the then-president-elect, while 37% viewed him unfavorably.

Since then, the Trump administration's military policies have run the gamut, from increasing military spending to his push to ban transgender troops from serving.

One military decision that is widely favored: his appointment of Defense Secretary James Mattis. More than 84% of troops said they had a favorable view of the secretary.
