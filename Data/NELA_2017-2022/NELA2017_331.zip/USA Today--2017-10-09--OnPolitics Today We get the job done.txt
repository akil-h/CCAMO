It's Monday, OP readers, and it has already been a week, between the feuds and the fires.

So, without further ado, let's get to it. (Subscribe here.)

The White House has sent Congress its wish list on immigration reform, and we have to put it bluntly: It's a lot of Republican hard-liners that Democrats have already balked at. Included in the proposal: providing funding for the wall, taking away grants from sanctuary cities and shifting to a merit-based immigration system.

With President Trump's demands, we may find ourselves in a stalemate. And that's bad news for DREAMers, the undocumented people who were brought into the country as children. The president has vowed to work with lawmakers on a deal, but if these are expectations, will a deal actually happen?

Sen. Bob Corker isn't running for re-election next year, which means the Tennessee Republican has nothing to lose. How can you tell? Well, for one, he tweeted over the weekend, "It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning."

So, what's the future of Corker and Trump trading mean tweets? You may see the senator deliver more straight-talk about his apparently very dismal views of the administration. And you can expect the president to lash back over and over and over again.

Vice President Pence went to Sunday's Indianapolis Colts-San Francisco 49ers' game. And then he walked out. What inspired his exit? The kneeling of some 49ers players, something that he, frankly, had to know was coming. The trip was "long planned," but the leaving wasn't, according to the White House.

His defense for why he left: He wants to support service members. "I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our flag, or our national anthem," Pence tweeted on Sunday.

The vice president hasn't served in the military, but his father and son have.
