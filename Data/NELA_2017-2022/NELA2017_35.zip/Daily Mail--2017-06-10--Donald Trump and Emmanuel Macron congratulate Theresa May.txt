Theresa May received telephone calls from the presidents of the US and France to 'congratulate' her on returning to Downing Street.

After the Tories saw their Commons majority wiped out as Mrs May sought to continue in power heading a minority administration backed by the Democratic Unionist Party, US President Donald Trump told the PM he looked forward to continued 'close co-operation', while Emmanuel Macron invited her to visit France.

Initially the US President had admitted the result had caught him off guard, but called his British counterpart to offer his 'warm support'.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 'US President Donald Trump called the Prime Minister to offer his congratulations.

'Both sides agreed they look forward to continuing the close cooperation between our two countries.

'The French President Emmanuel Macron called to congratulate the Prime Minister, and said he was pleased that she would continue to be a close partner.

'The president invited the Prime Minister to visit France at the earliest possible opportunity, and they agreed that the strong friendship between our two countries was important and would endure.'

Donald Trump and Theresa May spoke over the phone.

A White House spokesman said the Prime Minister and the President had agreed to continue the close cooperation between their two countries.

Trump stressed his commitment to the 'special relationship' between the United States and Britain and said he looked forward to working with May 'on shared goals and interests in the years to come'.
