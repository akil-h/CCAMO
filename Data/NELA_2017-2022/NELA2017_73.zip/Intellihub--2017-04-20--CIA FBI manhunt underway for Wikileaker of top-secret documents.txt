(INTELLIHUB) — In the age of Wikileaks there are spies and leakers everywhere who seek to partake in the current information war against the Deep State. In most cases, these dedicated individuals are valued operatives, freedom fighters, who represent the people’s best interests first and not the Establishment’s.

Needless to say, leakers serve as ‘thorns in the side’ for most three-letter agencies nowadays. Agencies such as the C.I.A. and N.S.A. typically used to only worry about spies from the outside and possibly an infiltrator or two here and there but are now forced to constantly monitor for newly emerging threats — other Edward Snowden’s who want to make their mark on history by exposing anything that goes against the grain of humanity.

Now the C.I.A. is firing back against leakers and has activated a manhunt to apprehend the person responsible for the “Vault 7” Wikileaks dump that included the highly-controversial “Weeping Angel” documents which show how smart T.V.s can be used to monitor individuals covertly by activating their microphone and camera.

“The proverbial carnage came after the C.I.A.’s prized “cyber-spying toolkit” was leaked into the public domain creating government distrust.,” Intellihub reported in early March.

“Documents contained within the dump prove that the C.I.A. has the capability to hack into smartphones and T.V.s and may even be using it to surveil U.S. persons of interest,” like Donald Trump and associates.

The C.I.A. and F.B.I. are currently looking for an “insider” who physically obtained the information from a “highly secure section” inside of the agency, CBS reports.
