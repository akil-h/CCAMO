In other words: These kids are being paid to tattle on other kids for anything they might consider to be a microaggression, and any students who gets these jobs should probably identify themselves so that other students will know to never invite them to their parties.

At 15 hours a week, the students can expect to make around $600/month to report nothing of value, the Daily Caller reports. This new type of paid activism sounds a lot like the types of recruitment techniques Nazi Germany might have used with their Hitler Youth.

Sounding a bit like a block leader in Soviet Russia, SJAs will “openly lead conversations, discuss differences, and confront diversely insensitive behavior.” When students are not complying with social justice standards, SJAs are encouraged to tattle on their peers, reveal the deviant actions to higher authorities and “report any bias incidents or claims to appropriate Residence Life staff.” Non-compliant students might achieve some degree of re-education through “real talks” that SJAs are expected to have with their fellow dorm students. The university stresses that one should not take the duties of an SJA lightly. “The position also aims to increase understanding of one’s own self through critical reflection of power and privilege, identity and intersectionality, systems of socialization, cultural competency, and allyship as they pertain to the acknowledgement, understanding, and acceptance of differences,” the online job description explains.
