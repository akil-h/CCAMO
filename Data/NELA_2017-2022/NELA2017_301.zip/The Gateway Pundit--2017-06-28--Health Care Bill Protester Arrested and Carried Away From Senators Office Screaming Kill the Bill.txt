As many as 150 activists traveled to Washington D.C. on Wednesday and protested against the Senate Republican bill for repealing and replacing Obamacare. Leandra Bernstein, Sinclair Broadcast Group’s national politics reporter, reported that afternoon that the demonstrators targeted at least six GOP senators’ offices. Bernstein listed Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Rob Portman (R-OH) as some of the protesters’ targets. At least 10 demonstrators visited Rubio’s D.C. office, bearing signs like “Don’t Take Our Health Care” and “Trump-Care = Death.”
