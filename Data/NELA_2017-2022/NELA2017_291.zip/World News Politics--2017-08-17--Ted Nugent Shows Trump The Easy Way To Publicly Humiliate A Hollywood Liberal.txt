Rock musician and conservative commentator Ted Nugent had some brutal words for singer David Crosby. Crosby called out Nugent for being “not good enough” to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

During an appearance on “The Fox News Specialists,” on Wednesday, Nugent called Crosby’s criticism a “badge of honor” and hurled several other insults at him as well:

“With all due respect to David Crosby — if any is due — here’s a bloated carcass that has abused his body all his life. He is a repository for every drug and chemical known to man. And if he doesn’t have that much respect or soul, then his criticism [of] me is a badge of honor. He can kiss my a**.”

Crosby and Nugent’s feud began because Ted Nugent told a radio host in Albany that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame didn’t induct him because he is a conservative. Seems reasonable enough. He specifically referred to Rolling Stone co-founder Iann Wenner. Wenner is a very overt liberal and hates the second amendment. She is also a part of choosing the inductees.

“I’m on the board of the directors of the NRA [National Rifle Association],” Nugent said last week. “Jann Wenner hates the Second Amendment so that’s the only reason I’m not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.”

When qustioned on Twitter about Nugent’s claim, Crosby dubbed Nugent as an “a**hole” and said that it was Nugent’s lack of talent that stopped him from entering the Hall of Fame.



 When Fox News host Eboni Williams asked Nugent whether he would be in the Hall of Fame if he were a liberal, Nugent said he would be “too stupid to carry on a conversation” if that were the case.
