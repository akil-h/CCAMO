Russia-gate keeps being pushed by the left. It’s actually disturbing at how much energy and time the left has focused on this.

It’s all been a ploy in order to tie the President’s hands so he can’t do his job. Well, the left is certainly doing their best for this.

Last week news broke that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had convened a grand jury, which issued its first subpoenas on August 3. Allegations of treason are common; prominent political figures and many media cultivate a case for impeachment.

This Russia story has truly corrupted a government that was seemingly at its max for corruption. It has been brimming for years and Mueller is pouring more corruption in the swamp.

It’s actually very disturbing that Mueller is still permitted in DC. There isn’t a positive that can come out of this until he fails. Then we know that even the left can’t take the left seriously anymore.

The future of American democracy rides on this presidency. If we allow them to remove a duly elected president, we will know for a fact that the democracy is lost in the greatest nation on Earth.

And now because of the sanctions, our relationship with Russia has suffered even more.

In retaliation, Moscow has announced that the United States must cut its embassy staff by roughly two-thirds. All sides agree that relations between the United States and Russia are now as fragile as they were during some of the Cold War’s worst moments. To suggest that military conflict between two nuclear powers inches ever closer can no longer be dismissed as hyperbole.

Now and ex-NSA agent said that the DNC was never hacked and not by the Russians. Neither was the election. So they can take this committee and cram it where the sun doesn’t shine.

What do you think about this?
