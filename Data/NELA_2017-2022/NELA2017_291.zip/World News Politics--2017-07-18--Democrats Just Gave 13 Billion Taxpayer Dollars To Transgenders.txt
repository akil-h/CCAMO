Taxpayer money is constantly wasted in Washington D.C. This isn’t exactly a new development.

But now, Democrats are legitimately finding ways to spend our cash on things that actually make no sense.

For example, why are we floating the boat to the tune of $1.3 billion in order to pay for surgeries of sexually confused men and women?

If you thought a Republican-controlled government might at least rein in some of the excessive, insane, Obama-era social experimentation being imposed on the United States military, you’d be sadly mistaken. Because on Thursday, the House of Representatives voted 214-209 to reject an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would have banned the Pentagon from paying for surgeries and hormone therapy for mentally disturbed individuals who are confused about what sex they are. The kicker? Twenty-four Republicans, including supposedly fiscally-conservative libertarian Justin Amash, made this travesty possible by bucking their party and voting with the united Democrats. The amendment, proposed by Missouri Rep. Vicky Hartzler, would have saved upwards of $1.3 billion over the next decade but hey, turning girls into boys and boys into girls is the least Uncle Sam can do for its “gender-confused” members. It’s not like there aren’t more important things to spend the money on, right? “This is about addressing [North] Korea, Russia, ISIS,” Hartzler said during the debate. “We need every defense dollar to go to meeting those threats, not anything else, and we need to make sure our troops are ready and can be deployed.”

The fact that 24 weak Republicans sided with these Dems makes things all the more worse.

If President Trump could put a stop to this you’d have to assume he would. Otherwise, what was all that talk about draining the swamp?
