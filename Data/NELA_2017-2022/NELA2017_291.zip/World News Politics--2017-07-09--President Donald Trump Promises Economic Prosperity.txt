During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Donald Trump said, “The era of economic surrender is over – and a new national pride is sweeping across our land.”



 President Donald Trump went into depth about how the White House is dedicating the month of July to “Made in America.” He wants to remember the world standard for quality, excellence, and craftsmanship that reside here. American craftsmanship has been the gold standard for centuries.

President Trump wants to restore the manufacturing industry in America. He even mentioned the mass of American manufacturing jobs that have been ripped from middle America and enabled other nations to get rich while we lost our industry. He considered it a “global theft of American wealth.”

“Since taking the oath of office, our government has adopted a new philosophy: AMERICA FIRST – and believe me, it’s about time. The era of economic surrender is over – and a new national pride is sweeping across our land. You see it, I see it, we all see it.”

Since recording began, industry confidence is at a record high. It would appear that President Trump is making good on his economic promises. Still awaiting that tax reform though.

The President had a lot of acts early in office and one of them was to enforce two simple rules: Buy American, and Hire American. We want to build with American Workers, and with American Iron, Aluminum and Steel.

Not to mention he wants to boost the domestic energy market. He’s done a good job so far with the ramping up in coal production, coal usage, and coal exportation.

He said he withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord because it was so one-sided. It was a horrible deal for America and so was the Trans Pacific Partnership. They were both job killers and very one-sided. He’s even renegotiating NAFTA. The President will terminate NAFTA if they can’t work it out the way it should be done.

It’s time for America to put America first.

What do you think of putting America first?
