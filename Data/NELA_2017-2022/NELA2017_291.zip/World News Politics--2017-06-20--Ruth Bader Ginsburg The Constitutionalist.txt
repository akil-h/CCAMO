Freedom of speech is one of the most basic rights of an American. Ruth Bader Ginsburg hasn’t been the staunchest supporter of the First Amendment. This Amendment allows Americans to criticize the moronic government.

Allowing people to criticize other people’s actions is covered by the same amendment as well, however, if the government decided to get involved in every petty dispute, the courts would be tied up for a long time.

In one such case though, the Supreme Court allowed all of the easily triggered to learn that they can’t use the government to twist other people’s words to their own will.

In a ruling that could help the NFL’s Washington Redskins, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday tossed out a federal prohibition on “offensive” trademarks as a constitutional violation in a massive free speech ruling involving a band called The Slants.

And Ruth Bader Ginsburg was on the right side of the ruling. The court ruled 8-0 in favor of the Portland, Oregon-based Asian-American dance rock band, which had been denied a trademark because the government deemed its name disparaging to people of Asian descent.

It’s incredible that the court actually agreed with free speech, It’s fairly worrying that this had to be a case in Supreme Court in the first place.

It’s clearly Constitutional rights being denied to kids.

Of course, the early generations of America didn’t have any garage bands, but if they did, the only ones instructing them what they could and couldn’t call they’re band would be their parents, not the feds.

Thankfully, the court did support the constitution and justice is delivered, but now we’re going to have to sift through all the other cases where someone was triggered for no certain reason.

What do you think of SCOTUS actually upholding our sacred document?
