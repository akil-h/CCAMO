The U.S. State Department removed a post promoting President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate Monday after heavy criticism in the news and social media — including a tweet from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. who noticed it on the website for the U.S. Embassy in London.

But where did it come from?

The post, which described the Trump property as the "winter White House" and detailed its history, first appeared April 4 on ShareAmerica.gov, a government website run by the State Department. The site purports to share "compelling stories and images that spark discussion and debate."

The U.S. embassy in London picked up the story on April 5 for its blog. The post only became a sensation on Monday after journalists noted it on Twitter.

The post, which published ahead of Chinese leader Xi Jinping's visit to with the president, reads, "Trump is not the first president to have access to Mar-a-Lago as a Florida retreat, but he is the first one to use it. By visiting this 'winter White House,' Trump is belatedly fulfilling the dream of Mar-a-Lago’s original owner and designer."

The Bureau of International Information Programs, which runs ShareAmerica.gov, did not immediately return a request for comment.
