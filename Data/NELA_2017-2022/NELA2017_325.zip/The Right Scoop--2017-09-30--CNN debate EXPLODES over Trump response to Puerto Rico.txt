Anti-Trumper Ana Navarro began yelling and screaming at pro-Trump zealot Andrea Bauer over the response from Trump to the devastation in Puerto Rico.

Watch below the moment the debate exploded:

Here’s the portion of the debate before everyone’s hair caught on fire.

Navarro actually brings some facts to the table, but a lot of them are opinions of people who are respected or should know what is going on in Puerto Rico. While Bauer rattles off some numbers, that’s only proof that *something* is being done, not necessarily proof that everything that should have been done was.

What it comes down to is this – that bad things happen isn’t evidence that Trump isn’t doing enough. BUT on the other side, just because the media is exaggerating in order to hurt Trump doesn’t mean he’s doing enough. Both sides are taking extremes and making foolish and irrational arguments. Which is the style these days.

Finally, Bauer makes the most absurdly stupid argument that Navarro has never said anything nice about Trump. Even if that were true, who gives a damn? The debate is whether she’s right about THIS point. It’s that kind of idiotic debate point that appeals to witless dullards but dumbs down everything. #MAGA!!
