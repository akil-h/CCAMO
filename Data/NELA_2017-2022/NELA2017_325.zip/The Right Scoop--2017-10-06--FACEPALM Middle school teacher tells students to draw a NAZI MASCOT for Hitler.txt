Here’s another dumb teacher story for you today where a teacher instructed her middle school students in Georgia to draw a mascot for the Nazi Party:

A middle school teacher in Georgia is under fire after she allegedly assigned students the task of creating a mascot for the Nazi party.

The homework assignment requested students in a social studies class at Shiloh Middle School, in Gwinnett County, to “think about all of the information that you have learned about Hitler and the Nazi party” and to create a mascot for it, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.

“The year is 1935 and you have been tasked with creating a mascot to represent the Nazi party at its political rallies,” the assignment read. “Think about all of the information that you have learned about Hitler and the Nazi party. You will create a COLORFUL illustration of the mascot. Give the mascot a NAME. You will also write an explanation as to why the mascot was chosen to represent the Nazi party.”

Objections to the assignment were raised by parent Jamie Brown, who thought it was inappropriate and questioned its purpose.

“When you talk about mascots, mascots are used to be happy, to promote something, a positive representation like UGA [sic] so really we doing a Nazi party mascot? What are we celebrating?” Brown told Fox 5.
