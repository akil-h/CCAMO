Being a spy during the Cold War would have been a lot of fun, I’d imagine.

I could never be a spy though. I talk too much when I’m drinking. And obviously, if you are a spy, you have to drink, or people will assume you’re a spy. I mean, especially if you’re Russian. Basically, the number one skill required to be a spy is to be able to avoid “in vino veritas” type troubles.

I’m not even joking when I say that I do imagine this is the number one determiner of whether or not you can be a deep cover spy – whether you can hold it together when you’re shitfaced.

In a Saturday interview with TV presenter Sergei Brilev in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that his work in the Soviet Committee for State Security, the KGB, was at times tied to ‘illegal intelligence.’ Putin joined the KGB in 1975 and served undercover in Dresden, East Germany, between 1985 and 1990.

Basically the KGB was operating in East Germany against the Jews, who fled there because Stalinism was so anti-Semitic.
