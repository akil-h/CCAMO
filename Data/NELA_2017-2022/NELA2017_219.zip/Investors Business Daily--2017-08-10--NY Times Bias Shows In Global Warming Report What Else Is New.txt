Media Bias: Like other former bastions of media respectability, the New York Times can't seem to get out of its own way these days. A big scoop it grandly published Tuesday about a "leaked" devastating report on global warming turns out to have been false.

The august Times acted as if the upcoming National Climate Assessment (NCA) was in danger of being cast into the darkness by the anti-warming trolls of the Trump administration. Luckily, or so we were made to think, some brave soul inside the bureaucracy bravely blew the whistle and gave a draft of the report to the Times, which promptly published it.

The only problem: The draft report has been online since January. As Michael Bastasch of the Daily Caller reported, there was no effort to stifle it at all, despite the Times quoting anonymous scientists saying "they fear that the Trump administration could change or suppress the report." How can you suppress what's already out?

As for "change," well, all reports go through changes. That's the nature of the bureaucratic beast. They're edited, reedited, pared down, changed, amended, altered, reorganized and, yes, even rewritten to suit the politics of the day. This is not a scientific process — it's a political one. And while the results are predictably political, it's not as if it's a process that was invented by Trump.

Even so, the Times seemed to suggest this is all being done in some nefarious way by the Trump administration to twist the report or soften it or even falsify it.

Actually, from what we've seen of past reports, it likely should be rewritten to reflect real science, diverging views and the emerging evidence that global warming science is fraught with outright fraud. By a law passed in the 1990s, the NCA is supposed to come out every four years. But, Patrick Michael, director of the Center for the Study of Science, notes: "There has only been three such documents produced to date, each horrible."

Even so, the Times suggested that the suppressed draft report would be particularly devastating to global warming skeptics, who are "equally worried that the draft report, as well as the larger (National Climate Assessment), will be publicly released."

Oops. On Wednesday, the Times was forced to correct its story.

"Correction: August 9, 2017

 An article on Tuesday about a sweeping federal climate change report referred incorrectly to the availability of the report. While it was not widely publicized, the report was uploaded by the nonprofit Internet Archive in January; it was not first made public by The New York Times."

So once again, The Times let its hatred for all things Trump cloud its journalistic judgment. Meanwhile, what it didn't say in its "correction" is that this casts into doubt the very premise of the story — that the report was being suppressed for political reasons. The story shouldn't just be corrected; it should be retracted.

This is a big reason why the Times has lost so much of its former journalistic prestige and public esteem: It seems to have become a party organ for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, rather than a fearless truth-teller that lives by the creed: "All the news that's fit to print."

Neither the draft reports nor the final National Climate Assessment itself are scientific documents; they are products of government-subsidized and employed scientists, bureaucrats and political operatives who all have powerful professional reasons to push the overarching global warming narrative that the Earth's temperature is soaring due to human-sourced CO2 emissions.

Yet the Times treats the contents of this report as if it were some kind of revealed truth from on high. Why? They've become a central cog in the left's propaganda machine that pushes the idea that "humanity" must do something drastic to halt global warming. Unfortunately, "doing something" means imposing strict government controls on both businesses and individual behavior, requiring major cuts in living standards and personal freedoms.

The Times and others almost never consider what the benefits of a warmer world might be. Or whether the heavily government-subsidized science and questionable models behind the climate change industry are valid or accurate.

No, just like much of the rest of the mainstream media, the Times can't be bothered with telling the truth about global warming, or reporting both sides in the scientific debate over it. Their readers deserve better.
