President Trump joined the rest of the nation observing the total solar eclipse Monday, watching from the White House and donning the requisite protective glasses — eventually.

Trump initially waltzed onto the Truman Balcony without wearing the protective glasses. When he looked up at the sky, a White House aide standing on the lawn below reportedly shouted, “Don’t look!”

The president, known for heeding his own advice, looked.

Looking directly at the sun is ill advised, even during an eclipse. It’s safe only for those within the path of totality, and even then only for the few brief minutes when the sun is completely covered by the moon. The White House is not in the path of totality.

First lady Melania Trump and the couple’s son, Barron, also appeared on the Truman Balcony,  as did the president’s daughter Ivanka, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who appeared particularly awestruck by the celestial event.

Lawmakers outside of Washington embraced eclipse mania as well.
