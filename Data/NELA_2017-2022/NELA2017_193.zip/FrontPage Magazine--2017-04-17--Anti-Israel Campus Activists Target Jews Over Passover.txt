Again we're ceaselessly told that the vast roster of anti-Israel hate groups are not anti-Semitic. (If you doubt that, just check out the token Jews they stick up front as shields for their bigotry.) They just happen to believe that Israel's failure to successfully negotiate an end to the conflict begun by Islamic colonialism because the Islamic terrorists refuse to compromise with Israel is the greatest human rights issue of our time.

And yet they act in exactly the kinds of ways that anti-Semites would.

Amid a slew of anti-Israel activities taking place at universities across the US during the Passover holiday this week, a leading campus activist told The Algemeiner on Thursday that proponents of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement were using the holiday as a means to eliminate pro-Israel voices. Ron Krudo — executive director of Israel education group StandWithUs — called the tactic of advancing BDS resolutions in student government on or immediately before Jewish holidays, when many Zionist leaders are off campus, “undemocratic.”

This isn't a new tactic. It is a toxic one. When you deliberately schedule your attacks around a Jewish holiday, you're making it obvious that your goals are to...

1. Harass Jews in particular by disrupting their holiday

2. Exploit the absence of Jews to target the Jewish State

And there are 3 key letters in all this. J-E-W.

Targeting Jews makes it obvious that the anti-Israel movement is anti-Semitic. It isn't picking out the Jewish State because it has a graver human rights situation than the rest of the world, but because it's full of Jews. But then again the anti-Israel hate cult has a long history of targeting Jewish celebrations and commemorations including Holocaust memorials.

But what would one expect from the ideology behind the Yom Kippur War, a surprise attack timed for the holiest period in the Jewish calendar.
