President Trump’s social media team has released yet another video of Trump’s big and Very Presidential trip to hurricane-ravaged Florida today, and once again, it’s all about him.

Only a few seconds of the video are devoted to the actual victims of Hurricane Irma – and Trump himself is the center of attention in every shot. His white “USA” hat, which he’s selling for a jaw dropping forty dollars in his campaign store, is also featured heavily throughout the short clip, marking yet another disgusting use of federal resources to promote fill his own pockets.

Millions are without power and millions of people had to flee the wrath of Hurricane Irma, but all the President can be bothered to do is snap a few photos, shake a few hands, and fly back to Washington before ordering his team to create an entire commemorative video for him, like his staff is a proud parent watching their child on his First Florida Hurricane Visit.
