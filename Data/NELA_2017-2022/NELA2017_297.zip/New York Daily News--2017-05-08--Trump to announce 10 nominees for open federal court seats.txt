President Trump will announce on Monday 10 nominees for various federal court vacancies, The New York Times reported.

The announcement mark the latest effort by Trump, whose Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch was confirmed and seated last month, to remake the nation's judiciary with conservative justices.

There are currently more than 120 vacancies on lower federal courts.

During his presidential campaign, Trump had released a list of jurists he said he would choose from to pick his Supreme Court nominee. Several of the judges who will be announced as nominees to lower federal courts on Monday were also on that list.

Among them are Michigan State Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, who Trump will reportedly nominate to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth District, and Minnesota State Supreme Court Justice David Stras, who Trump will reportedly nominate to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

Trump will also nominate Amy Coney Barrett, a law professor at Notre Dame, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and John Bush, an attorney in Louisville, Ky., to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, The Times reported.
