An Alaska state senator slapped a reporter who wrote a critical story about the lawmaker, according to a report.

Alaska Dispatch News reporter Nathaniel Herz told Juneau police state Sen. David Wilson (R-Wasilla) struck him at the capitol during a discussion Tuesday afternoon, his newspaper reported.

Herz penned a story that appeared in last Sunday’s newspaper about a proposed funding cut to service groups in Wilson’s home district. The cuts wouldn’t hurt Alaska Family Services, a social service group where Wilson worked before the freshman Republican took office.

The reporter caught up with Wilson in a stairwell at the capitol Tuesday afternoon, the Alaska Dispatch News reported, and he began recording their exchange on his cellphone.

“What’d you think, was that reasonable?” Herz is heard asking the senator.

“Fair?” the reporter says next.

Then there’s the sound of a sigh — followed by a slapping noise.

“Was that serious, or playful, or like...” Herz asks Wilson after nervously laughing.

He then tells another senator that Wilson slapped him and “That was interesting.”

Herz filed a police report with the Juneau Police Department, but Wilson hasn’t been charged.

“I was not enthusiastic about taking this to the police,” Herz told another Alaska Dispatch News reporter. “But I also felt like I couldn't accept this kind of behavior from a public official.”

Wilson didn’t return the newspaper’s multiple requests for comment — and Herz hasn’t spoken to the politician since.

“The Senate expects professional conduct and decorum from all members. Until the full facts surrounding the situation described are available, we have no further comment,” a senate majority spokesman told the Alaska Dispatch News via email.

Wilson isn’t the first Wasilla lawmaker to grab headlines. Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate and conservative firebrand, was mayor of the city from 1996 to 2002.
