In spite of his early morning tweet, Donald Trump was wrong about his Great Wall on the nation’s southern border stopping “human trafficking.” Trump’s wall definitely will not prevent the Kentucky Derby from attracting one of the most evil subspecies, human traffickers.

They sell women and children for sex during big events, like that at Churchill Downs. The underground sex trade is a real issue. Trump tweeted:

‘Don’t let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc.’

‘We must open our eyes and realize it is an issue. You would expect to see more incidents of human trafficking during those types of events because of opportunity, and people are there.

Professor at the University of Louisville who teaches courses on human trafficking Dr. Theresa Hayden indicated that a classified website for buying and selling innocents called Backpage.com peaks during Derby.
