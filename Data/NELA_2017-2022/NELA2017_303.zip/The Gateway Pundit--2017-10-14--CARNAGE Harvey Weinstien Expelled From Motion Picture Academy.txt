On October 5th, The New York Times blew the roof off of the decades long ‘open secret’ in Hollywood that Harvey Weinstein was essentially a sexual predator who preyed on young starlets. Weinstein reportedly paid off several sexual harassment accusers over the years.

A tsunami of women have since come forward with their horror stories of sexual harassment and sexual abuse by Harvey Weinstein, including A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie.

The New Yorker also dropped a bombshell alleging Weinstein raped three women: the story dominated the Drudge Report’s headline in bright red letters.

The Wrap reported that Weinstein was fired by his board of directors last Sunday.

Harvey Weinstein has been expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the L.A. Times reports.

Embattled film mogul Harvey Weinstein — a once-dominant force in the AcademyAwards who rewrote the rules of Oscar campaigning — has been expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in response to mounting allegations of sexual harassment and assault against him. The film academy’s 54-member board of governors, which includes such industry luminaries as Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Kathleen Kennedy and Whoopi Goldberg, voted in an emergency meeting on Saturday morning to remove Weinstein from the organization’s ranks in an unprecedented public rebuke of a prominent industry figure. The move marked the latest blow in Weinstein’s stunning downfall and, in symbolic terms, amounts to a virtual expulsion from Hollywood itself.
