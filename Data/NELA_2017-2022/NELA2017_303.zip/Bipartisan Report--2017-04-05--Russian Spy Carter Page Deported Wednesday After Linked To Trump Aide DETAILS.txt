The last member still in the United States of a Russian spy ring linked to Trump aide Carter Page has been deported to Russia.

As reported in a press release from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement:

Evgeny Buryakov was recently released from federal prison for his role in the spy ring’s activities, and it was a part of his plea deal that he would be turned over to federal custody for deportation upon his release from prison. He was released on March 31.

Obviously, the issue of having an individual working as a covert agent for the Russian government inside the United States is serious enough by itself. Buryakov’s “cover job” was as the number two guy at a New York office of a (sanctioned) Russian state-run bank. The other two guys in his ring, who both had “cover jobs” as legitimate officials of the Russian government, managed to get out of the country and back to Russia before they could be apprehended by federal authorities.

Rebecca Adducci, who serves as field office director for the Detroit office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, commented of Buryakov’s deportation:

Indeed, seeking to “potentially compromise the security of our nation” is precisely what Buryakov did in secretly passing off information to Putin; it’s a good thing that he’s gone.

That’s not, however, where the story ends. The Russian spy ring of which Buryakov was a part is, actually, connected to Trump aide Carter Page. Page was cultivated by the members of the spy ring for the purpose of gathering information for them, as was revealed recently. Page has thus far gotten out of any legal repercussions for handing off documents to the Russian spies by maintaining that he didn’t know that they were spies. Since he’s not in jail, the FBI evidently has reason to believe him.
