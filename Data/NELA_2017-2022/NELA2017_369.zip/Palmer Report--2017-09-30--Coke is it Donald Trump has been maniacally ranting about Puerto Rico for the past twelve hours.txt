When Donald Trump began staying up all night tweeting crazed nonsense during the general election and then sniffing his way through his public appearances, many Americans began questioning if he was high on cocaine. That question was never definitively answered, as Trump refused to disclose his medical records. But his performance today is once again raising questions about whether Trump’s maniacal behavior may be chemically influenced.

Trump woke up this morning and began frantically tweeting out one inappropriate attack after another, as he tried to distract from the ineptness of his initial response to the post-hurricane crisis in the United States territory of Puerto Rico. He tweeted that the female mayor of San Juan was “nasty” while implying that the people of Puerto Rico were too lazy to want to help out in their own relief effort. But then, like a drugged out Energizer Bunny, he just kept going… and going.

Trump put out six different tweets today about how the adverse conditions in Puerto Rico are all “fake news” and that the recovery effort is going fantastically. He even made a direct appeal to the people in Puerto Rico, urging them not to pay attention to all of the supposed “fake news” in question. This only served to demonstrate how thoroughly Trump has failed to grasp the situation. Almost no one on the island has electricity or internet or cell service, meaning they can’t watch the news one way or the other. But it got worse.

Over the past twelve hours, Donald Trump has now posted no less than eighteen frantic tweets about Puerto Rico. All of them were in the name of either defending his own failed response to Puerto Rico, or attacking various people in Puerto Rico, or attacking the media for accurately covering his failed response. At this point the question may whether Trump is on drugs, or whether he needs to be on drugs.
