China tells India not ‘to push your luck’ and pull back troops from Doklam plateau amid rising tension.

China has demanded that India pull back its troops from a contested region high in the Himalayas, warning New Delhi not “to push your luck” amid a festering border dispute.

According to Indian officials, about 300 soldiers from either side face each other about 150 metres apart on the Doklam plateau, an area also claimed by India’s ally Bhutan.

What do you think India Should do?

The stand-off began in June when Chinese troops started building a road onto the plateau towards India’s border.

Bhutan sought help from India, which sent troops across the border from the northeastern state of Sikkim.
