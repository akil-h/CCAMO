White House Chief of Staff John Kelly fired White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci just 10 days after the Wall Street financier took the job.

Sources told The New York Times that Kelly said to “members of the White House staff at a meeting Monday morning that he is in charge.” The move also comes days after Scaramucci went on a profanity-laden rant against top White House officials.

Scaramucci took over White House communications in late July, forcing out former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer who was known for his combative approach to dealing with reporters. Scaramucci’s rise also forced out former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.

Scaramucci was a prominent campaign surrogate for President Donald Trump on the campaign trail, and formerly served on the board of the Export-Import bank.

The Washington Post confirmed the move, noting it was part of Kelly’s push to “tame chaos” in the West Wing.

Kelly took over as chief of staff Monday and likely made firing Scaramucci one of his first moves. Scaramucci was never officially sworn in as White House staff.
