Stephen Colbert mocked President Trump after the president said during an event Wednesday that his daughter Ivanka Trump referred to him as "daddy."

"By far, the most awkward moment — and for Trump, that's a pretty high bar — was when he brought up Ivanka," Colbert said during "The Late Show."

Colbert then cited a clip of Trump speaking about his daughter during an earlier event on tax reform.

“She said, ‘Dad, can I go with you,'” Trump said while introducing his daughter, who is also a White House adviser, at the speech. “Actually she said ‘Daddy, can I go with you?' I like that.”

“I said, 'Yes, you can,'" he added.

"Not weird at all," Colbert said, following the clip. "All of Trump's advisers call him daddy. Sean Spicer was actually the one who started it."

The president traveled to North Dakota on Wednesday as part of his push to pass tax reform through Congress.

Trump during speeches frequently singles out his daughter and her work.

Ivanka Trump on Wednesday also briefly addressed the crowd in North Dakota.

"Hi, North Dakota, we love this state so it’s always a pleasure to be back here," she said.

"You treated us very, very well in November and have continued to, so we like showing the love back," she added.
