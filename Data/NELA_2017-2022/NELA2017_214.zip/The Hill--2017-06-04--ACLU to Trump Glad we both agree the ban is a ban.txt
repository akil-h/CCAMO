The American Civil Liberties Union tweeted their thanks to President Trump Sunday for calling his travel ban a ban, after his administration previously insisted the executive order was not one.

The ACLU tweeted "Glad we both agree the ban is a ban" in response to Trump's tweet saying that the U.S. needed his "travel ban" in place after a terror attack in London left at least seven dead and nearly 50 wounded.

Press secretary Sean Spicer has previously denied that Trump's executive order temporarily blocking entry to the U.S. of refugees and travelers from several majority-Muslim countries should be called a "ban," despite Trump using the term himself.

Federal judges have blocked the ban, which has been tweaked to include entry from only six majority-Muslim countries. The Trump administration appealed the decision to the Supreme Court last week.

"We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!" Trump tweeted Saturday.
