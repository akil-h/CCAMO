While speaking at the SkyBridge Capital event in Vegas, Biden said, “I never thought she was the correct candidate. I thought I was the correct candidate,” a tweet from Fusion’s Hamilton Nolan asserts.

Sounds like Biden might be a bit bitter?

The audience apparently exploded with applause following Biden’s comments on Hillary.

Another tweet, this one from Robert Wolf, the former President and COO of UBS Investment Bank, quotes Biden talking about a potential 2020 run at the Presidency, “Could I run? Yes. Will I? Probably not, but I may very well do it.”

While discussing Clinton’s 2016 candidacy, Biden told the crowd, “I never thought she was the correct candidate. I thought I was the correct candidate,” according to a tweet from Fusion reporter Hamilton Nolan. This is not the first shot at the former secretary of state from Biden. In March he appeared to attack Clinton for ignoring the middle class during the election saying, “This is the first campaign that I can recall where my party did not talk about what it always stood for, and that is how to maintain a burgeoning middle class.”
