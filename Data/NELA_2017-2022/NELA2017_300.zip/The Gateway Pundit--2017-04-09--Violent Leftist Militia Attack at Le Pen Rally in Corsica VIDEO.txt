The altercations this Saturday in Corsica saw over a dozen violent, leftist protestors removed from the location and shortly after an evacuation of the hall where French National Front candidate, Marine Le Pen was supposed to speak in Ajaccio, Corsica.

Around 50 people demonstrated in front of the venue in Ajaccio, chanting “We do not want the National Front”, according to local newspaper Corse Matin. Some of them managed to enter the hall where Le Pen was expected to speak. They clashed with Le Pen’s security team and fired teargas, prompting the evacuation of the hall, the newspaper said. The event was moved to another venue, French television BFM TV said.

David Rachline, the campaign manager for Marine Le Pen, indicated on Twitter that the local authorities had failed at securing the venue and had not done enough to keep everyone safe. Rachline also stated that a National Front activist was seriously injured during the attack by the far-left “militia”.
