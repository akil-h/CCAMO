Hot Cross Buns have begun to appear on supermarket shelves, it has been revealed.

With just 348 days until Easter, a Woolworth’s spokesperson said consumers were running out of time to pick up a raisin-filled treat to share with family and friends.

“We’ve got some last minute specials on 2018 Easter eggs and hot cross buns – so rush in now,” he said.

He said the new range of hot cross buns are displayed on the shelf next to 2017 end-of-season eggs, which are now heavily discounted. “You can catch up on your 2017 Easter shopping and get your 2018 shopping out of the way at the same time”.
