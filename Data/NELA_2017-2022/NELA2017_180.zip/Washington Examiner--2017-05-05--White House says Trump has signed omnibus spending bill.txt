The White House announced that President Trump signed the $1.2 trillion spending agreement to fund the government through September early Friday afternoon.

When asked at Friday's briefing whether Trump still plans to sign the bill and avoid a shutdown, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said that Trump just did.

"Yes, I believe, actually, he signed it just within the last hour," she said.

Trump is working at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster, N.J. on Friday after spending Thursday evening in New York City.
