The vice chairman of President Trump's voter fraud commission denied the group is set up to prove Trump's claim that between 3 and 5 million illegal immigrants voted in the 2016 presidential election.

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said on CNN it's not his job, or anyone else's job, to prove Trump's claim that he lost the popular vote because illegal votes were cast for Hillary Clinton.

"The commission is not set up to disprove or to prove President Trump's claim, nor is it only looking at the 2016 election," Kobach said.

Trump, who won the election based on the Electoral College, has claimed he only lost the popular vote because millions of illegal votes were cast in California and New York. Those states are heavily Democratic and voted against Trump.

There is no evidence of large-scale illegal voting.

Kobach said the commission is important because it's the first time the entire country's various voting systems will be analyzed by one body.

"It's the first time we'll have a nationwide fact finding effort to see what evidence of what forms of voter fraud there are across the country," Kobach said.
