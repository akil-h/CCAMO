BOSTON (CBS) – TSA agents have found a number of strange things in luggage over the years, but their latest unusual discovery is uniquely New England.

A spokesman shared a photo Monday of a lobster weighing more than 20 pounds. The crustacean was detected in a checked bag in Terminal C (JetBlue) on Sunday morning.

Lobsters can travel in either carry-on or checked bags. They’re a common sight at New England airports, but this one was notable because of how large it is.

The TSA tells WBZ-TV that the lobster was traveling in a cooler and was alive and well.
