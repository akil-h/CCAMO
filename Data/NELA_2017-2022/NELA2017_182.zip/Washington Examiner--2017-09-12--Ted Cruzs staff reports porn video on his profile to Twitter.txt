The staff of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, informed Twitter early Tuesday about a pornographic video his personal social media account "liked" overnight.

Cruz's communications director Catherine Frazier tweeted the update shortly after 2 a.m. EST.

"The offensive tweet posted on @tedcruz account earlier has been removed by staff and reported to Twitter," Frazier wrote.

The specific account is called @sexuallposts and the tweet his account "liked" linked to a two-minute video.

The tweet was removed around 1:20 a.m. EST.

Cruz has two Twitter accounts, including @SenTedCruz, which is used for official Senate tweets.

Cruz's refusal to take blame for the incident indicates he may say the account has been hacked or an aide with access to the account took the action.

The write-up at the top of the pornographic Twitter account now reads "Follow @tedcruz's Favorite Twitter Porn Account."
