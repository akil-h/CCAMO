President Trump has made error after error this week, there’s no denying it. From calling former FBI Director James Comey a “nut job” to admitting to leaking classified intelligence to Russian officials, he’s made it perfectly clear that he is unqualified for his job. There are still people who are trying to defend him, though, much to CNN anchor Anderson Cooper’s frustration.

Cooper made it clear on Friday night that he was not going to put up with anyone trying to defend Trump’s poor judgment.

On Friday evening, Jeffrey Lord, a CNN commentator who is also a devout Trump supporter, defended the president’s right to call Comey any name he wanted. He said specifically:

At this point, unable to hold his tongue any longer, Cooper interrupted Lord and said:

Cooper’s remark certainly caught Lord off guard, although the commentator’s laughter suggested that he was not terribly offended.

Cooper also followed up his comment by saying, while chuckling:

Later on during the segment, Cooper backtracked slightly and apologized for being “a little crude.” He added that he thinks Lord’s voice is “an important” one to have on the show.

Cooper also apologized for the remark on Twitter later on Friday evening.

Cooper may regret the comment, but plenty of people on Twitter have made it clear that they thoroughly enjoyed it.
