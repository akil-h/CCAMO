On Monday afternoon, former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates is set to offer testimony about the Trump camp’s connections to Russia before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism.

Yates’s role in this scandal is having warned the Trump White House of the dangerous connections to Russia on the part of the now fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

Flynn met with the Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergei Kisylak to discuss the Trump administration’s intent to lift sanctions against Kisylak’s country. Besides the fact that such a conversation breaks the law, Flynn lied about ever having had the conversation at all, which is what led to his firing.

Flynn also was revealed to have lied about having accepted cash payments from Kremlin-connected entities that he was required to disclose.

The Trump administration’s defense for all of this is to say that they were only going on Flynn’s Obama-era security clearance when accepting him into the White House. Flynn headed the Defense Intelligence Agency until 2014.

It’s along these lines that Trump tweeted on Monday, writing, “General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration — but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.”

The thing is, this tweet — like pretty much every other one — does absolutely nothing to help Trump’s case.

His administration was the one that accepted Flynn; the responsibility for having a Russian connected individual in the White House is on Trump, not Obama.

As artist Mike Denison pointed out in Trump’s comments section, Trump further cemented that responsibility for Flynn rests with him and him alone when his administration waited weeks to act on a warning from Sally Yates about Flynn’s Russia connections.
