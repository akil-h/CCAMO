It took a bit longer than almost everyone expected, but it appears that MSNBC and CNN have fully caught on to what their audiences want. MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace talked about a series of topics that included DACA, Russia, and Ivanka Trump’s declining influence. CNN’s Jake Tapper talked about Hurricane Irma, Trump Jr., Russia, and Trump’s deal with Democrats on the debt ceiling.

Trump’s speech was ignored by two of the three cable news networks. Tax reform is one of those boring topics that cable news largely ignores, but the fact that two of the three networks ignored his speech suggests that that cable news coverage that Trump depended on during the campaign and in the early days of his presidency is fading fast.

The Russia scandal is overshadowing Trump, and the American people are not getting fooled by the same old Republican boiler plate lies about tax cuts for the wealthy will grow the economy anymore.

The cable news networks are finally breaking their addiction to Donald Trump.
