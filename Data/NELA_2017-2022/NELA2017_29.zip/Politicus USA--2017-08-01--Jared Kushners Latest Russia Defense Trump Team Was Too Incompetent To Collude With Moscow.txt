Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has a new excuse for why the Trump campaign couldn’t have possibly colluded with Russia, and it’s a beauty.

In a private discussion with congressional interns, Kushner said that the Trump team was so incompetent and disorganized that there is no way it could have worked with a foreign adversary to influence the presidential election.

“They thought we colluded, but we couldn’t even collude with our local offices,” Kushner told the interns during a private meeting on Monday, according to Foreign Policy.

With respect to the ongoing special counsel investigation being run by Robert Mueller, Kushner said, “We don’t know where it’s going.”

Kushner’s comments sound like a stunning admission that his father-in-law is too incompetent to run a campaign, much less a country, but Foreign Policy notes that “a defense claiming chaos and confusion might be the key difference between criminal behavior and incompetence.”

In other words, Kushner seems to be laying the ground work for the administration’s key defense: We’re not corrupt, we’re just deeply incompetent.

So if you’re keeping score at home, there are two possibilities here: 1. The Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to swing the election in their candidate’s favor; or 2. The president’s team was so disorganized and chaotic that it would’ve been impossible for them to coordinate with Russia.

Of course, it’s likely that a little of both are true.

The Trump campaign wasn’t too chaotic and disorganized to collude with the Russians; they were just too incompetent to get away with it.
