While campaigning for Alabama Senate runoff candidate, President Donald Trump went on a tangent and called former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick as a “son of a b*tch.”

“‘Wouldn’t you love to see one of our NFL owners, when somebody disrespects the flag, say, ‘Get that son of a b*tch off the field right now. Out. He’s fired…FIRED!’” Trump said at the rally.

The crowd of Trump supporters respond by chanting USA, USA, USA, as Trump smugly smiles while leaning to the side. Impressing even himself with how easily he can manipulate his supporters.

Trump continues, suggesting again that NFL owners, his friends, should fire people for what he calls “disrespecting the flag” and disrespecting our “heritage”, proving he has no idea why people are actually kneeling during the anthem.



 Immediately, Twitter took Trump to task over his language and behavior.

“When was the last time a sitting President said ‘son of a b*tch‘ on purpose at a rally?” activist-journalist Sean King tweeted. “Has that ever happened?”
