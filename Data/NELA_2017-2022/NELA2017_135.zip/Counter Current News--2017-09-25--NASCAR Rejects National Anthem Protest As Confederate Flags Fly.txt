NASCAR, a sport built on Confederate flags and white pride, will not tolerate national anthem protests against racial injustice.

Bottom line: NASCAR doesn’t want anyone protesting racial injustice, but they will gladly coddle white supremacists wallowing in racism while waving their Confederate flags.
