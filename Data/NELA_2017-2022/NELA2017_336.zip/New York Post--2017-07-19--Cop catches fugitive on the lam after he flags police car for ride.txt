A Louisiana man left stranded on the side of the road flagged down what turned out to be a police car and was arrested for outstanding warrants early Monday morning.

There had been a warrant out for the arrest of 30-year-old Jansen Simon since he allegedly used a hammer to pummel another man in the head during a bar fight. The Lafourche Parish Sheriff’s Office reported the fight broke out in Cut Off, Louisiana on August 3, 2013.

Simon was walking on the side of Highway 182 in Raceland early Monday. He stopped the deputy, who was in a marked police car heading home for the night. Simon was left by his friends on the side of the road, according to the sheriff’s department.

As is protocol for any stranded person picked up by a deputy, the officer verified Simon’s identity and found his arrest warrant, as well as two contempt of court warrants from the same time period.

“It’s not clear whether he knew he was flagging down a deputy,” LPSO spokesman Brennan Matherne told Fox 31. “Although it was a fully marked patrol car, it was also 1:30 in the morning.”

Simon is being held without bail in the Lafourche Parish Detention Center in Thibodaux, Louisiana, where he was booked for one count of aggravated second degree battery and two counts of contempt of court, according to the LPSO.
