The media is all lined up against President Trump. They have been for some time. But they used to love him.

And they still do, don’t believe a word they say because he still brings in what the media craves most – huge ratings.

They are a business and Trump sells.

Whether bashing or praising him, someone is interested and so the media picks their slant and off they go to the cash the checks.

But we do expect them to report the truth even when it conflicts with their phony, well-crafted narrative.

But when the truth is good for Trump, helps him and his agenda against the massive onslaught of establishment enemies, the media will go deaf, dumb, and blind in a hurry.

Like they did yesterday when some spectacular economic news broke.

But Trump is a master at the media game and particularly social media and he just embarrassed them.

The media is not reporting the tremendous economic news that just broke yesterday so Trump bypassed them and took his winning case directly to the voters.

He tweeted out the truth to the media’s everlasting shame. But they should be happy because we all benefit from a strong economy.

“Very little reporting about the GREAT GDP numbers announced yesterday (3.0 despite the big hurricane hits). Best consecutive Q’s in years!,” Trump tweeted.

Help Trump bypass the media and get the great news out there by sharing this everywhere.
