The esteemed Sebastian Gorka may well have hit on what it is about President Trump that Republican voters love so much.

Namely, that he’s “kryptonite” to political correctness. (Kryptonite being the one substance that can stop the comic book hero, Superman .)

[President Trump] bumped me from the [Values Voters Summit] — I was supposed to speak with them that day, I spoke to them yesterday. And I felt like opening my speech with Merry Christmas, even though it may be October.

This is a man, who the first time I met him in 2015, I knew Donald Trump is the Kryptonite of political correctness. And he is going to bring it back. We are a Judeo-Christian country. God bless him, and his Twitter feed.

It may well be true that the President is the only thing that can stand against the tide of political correctness.

Can you think of any other political figure that could have said/done any of the politically incorrect things that President Trump has in recent months, and still survived to be elected?

Any other politician would have been forced to resign if they’d said what the President was heard saying in the “Access Hollywood” tapes. Any other politicians would have likely never won office had they written a book where they admitted to having many extramarital affairs.

Donald Trump can say and do things that other politicians can’t because he’s unlike any other politician to ever run for a major political office in American history.

He truly is “kryptonite” to political correctness… and that’s probably a good thing for us all.
