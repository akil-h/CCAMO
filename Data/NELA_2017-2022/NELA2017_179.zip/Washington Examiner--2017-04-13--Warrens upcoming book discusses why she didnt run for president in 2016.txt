Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren explains her thinking on why she decided not to run for president in 2016 in her upcoming book.

The progressive favorite writes that she asked for advice from her husband, Bruce Mann, who warned that the race could be more toxic than the environment she faced in her 2012 bid for U.S. Senate.

"I knew what he would say first, and he said it: 'I want you to do whatever you want to do. I'll be there,'" she wrote in "This Fight is Our Fight," which is due for release Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that it got a sneak peak at the book from the conservative research group America Rising.

Warren went on to add that her husband told her that "a race like this one looks pretty terrible. The Senate thing was bad enough, and running for president would be worse â€” a lot worse.'"

While Warren never announced an intent to run, she did have a progressive kindred spirit in Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who lost the Democratic primary to Hillary Clinton. Warren, like Sanders, later endorsed Clinton and appeared with her on the campaign trail.
