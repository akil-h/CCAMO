Academia in this country has become nothing more than a liberal indoctrination program.

That’s not a generalization either.  Virtually every college campus in America has abandoned the idea of free speech and individual thought in favor of identity politics, safe spaces, and race baiting.

Check out the breakdown of political donations from Ivy League schools.

Faculty members from the eight Ivy League schools poured over $2.5 million into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, a figure over 150 times larger than the approximately $15,000 spent to help elect President Donald Trump, The Daily Caller News Foundation calculated Saturday. Faculty at Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Dartmouth, and Brown spent a total of $2,609,943 on Clinton’s campaign and $15,190 on her general election rival, Trump, according to data culled from The Center for Responsive Politics.

Simply put, academic institutions in this country have no understanding of how people feel in between West Hollywood and Manhattan.

We all know that college campuses are liberal but this is pretty startling.

College students are being cranked out into the real world on a yearly basis after four years of being told the president is the enemy.

It would be interesting to see where the $15,000 to Trump came from.

Those teachers better hope their names never get out there.  They won’t have a job much longer.
