In a really interesting exchange this morning with KT Macfarland of the Trump admin, she will not say whether the U.S. sabotaged the North Korean missile to fail almost immediately after they fired it.

This is really interesting because we used a similar tactic to shut down the nuclear aspirations for Iran, before Obama gave them everything they wanted. Was this some kind of stuxnet attack? The admin just won’t say…
