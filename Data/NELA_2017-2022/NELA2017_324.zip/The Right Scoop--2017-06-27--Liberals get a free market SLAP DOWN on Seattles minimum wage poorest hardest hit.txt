It turns out that very simple economic principles have more basis in reality than liberals’ unicorn fart-dreams, as we all might have expected. Unless you’re a dumb liberal.

A new study confirms what every conservative believes about raising the minimum wage – it actually hurts the people it’s supposed to help.

So it turns out that employers cut back on hours and it ends up hurting the worker, even though they’re getting paid more per hour. How weird!!

And this is in Seattle where you would expect all those hippy dippy bleeding heart morons would actually act against their economic interest in order to prove how magnanimous they are. But actually, they never do that – they only want to impose those laws on OTHER people, right?

Now go tweet this at a liberal and laugh at them heartily hahahaha!!
