Apparently Trump and McConnell are still on the outs, at least in Alabama where Trump threw him under the bus today to help get Luther Strange elected. He actually said Strange would be fighting against McConnell in the Senate:

CNN – “As you know, Mitch is not, polling-wise, the most popular guy in this country,” Trump said. “They like to label (Strange) because he happened to be there for a number of months in the Senate, so they like to label him as Mitch’s best friend but he’s not. He hardly even knows him. He’ll be fighting Mitch.”

“I know he’s going to fight him on that ridiculous filibuster rule where you need 60 votes instead of 50 or 51,” Trump added. “That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen. So that means we need eight Democrats, and the Republicans can end it. And Mitch wants to keep it, which is ridiculous by the way. But Mitch wants to keep it. How do you get votes? That means you get eight Democrats every time. It is absolutely insanity to keep it. The Republicans have a very slim margin.”

“He was sort of unfairly labeled. They have him as best friends with Mitch McConnell. He doesn’t even know Mitch,” Trump said. “I mean, he met him a few months ago. You know when he came into Washington, he got to know him a little bit, but he virtually doesn’t even know him, but they tried to put that tag on him. You know politics is a dirty business. You guys might have figured that out by now.”
