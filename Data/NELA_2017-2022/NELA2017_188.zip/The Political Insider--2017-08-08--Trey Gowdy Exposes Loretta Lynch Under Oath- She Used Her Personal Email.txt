A bombshell report broke yesterday that President Barack Obama’s Attorney General – Loretta Lynch- used her personal email under pseudonyms. She used her grandmother’s name on a personal address to send emails about Department of Justice business, including details of the secret meeting with former President Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac.

We now know Lynch put sensitive information in a private email account. Apparently, she was following in Hillary Clinton’s footsteps!

Watch as conservative hero Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) questions Lynch. If you watch closely, you will notice something interesting:

Did you spot it? She told Gowdy, while under oath, she never used personal email for DOJ communications. That is a total lie, and a criminal offense.

Lynch used a fake name, and clearly knew the sensitive, political nature of the messages, which is why she didn’t want everything saved on DOJ servers.

What do you think about Lynch lying under oath about using a personal email account for DOJ issues? Please leave us a comment (Below) and tell us.
