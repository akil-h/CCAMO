During Obama’s presidency, it was reported that hundreds of thousands of veterans died waiting for care at the VA.

And yes, this issue has fingerprints of both parties on it but Dems have had the podium for 8 years and nothing has been done to fix the VA.

That was a huge campaign issue for Trump who promised to bring much-needed reform to the veterans who desperately need it.

Now, more fantastic news on the VA front.

It’s only been a few weeks since President Trump signed the VA reform bill into law, but we may already be seeing some results which have been developing since the inauguration. CBS News reports that the Department of Veterans Affairs, still struggling with a years long series of scandals with their personnel, has fired more than 500 workers since January and has applied disciplinary procedures to hundreds more. This is so out of keeping with the usual practices of the department that it’s clearly noteworthy. The Department of Veterans Affairs announced today that more than 500 officials have been fired for misconduct since President Trump took office earlier this year, according to data posted online. In an effort for more transparency and accountability within the VA, Secretary of Veterans Affairs David J. Shulkin announced that a public list of employee “accountability actions” will be posted online and updated weekly. The list outlines a total of 747 disciplinary actions including 526 employees who were fired since January 20.

It’s not rocket science. The American people are just looking for accountability.

The people who were running the show the last decade or so have no business going anywhere near another VA hospital.

This is just a first step but it sure is an impressive one.
