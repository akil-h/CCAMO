We have been trying to figure out the North Korea problem for decades and the results haven’t been great.

We’ve tried sanctions. Political pressure. Threat of violence.  None of it has succeeded in getting them to stop their nuclear program.

One Fox News host just suggested another option and it’s getting a lot of attention…

An outspoken Fox Business host suggested Thursday that perhaps the Trump administration should consider resolving the North Korean debacle by simply assassinating unhinged dictator Kim Jong Un. “There’s one other option here that we haven’t talked about,” host Trish Regan began with apparent reluctance during an appearance on sister network Fox News’ “Outnumbered.” “I know you’re not supposed to … take out a leader because of international rules, decorum, et cetera, that we have. But if there is a way to get in and get rid of this crazy fat kid … then wouldn’t that do a lot in terms of saving a lot of lives here?”

Hey, the United States has been involved in coups and secret operations like that for a long time now.

I’m not opposed to sending SEAL Team Six in there. Kim Jong Un is one of the most evil people on the planet.

The only problem, of course, is that Kim Jong has likely set up a plan for chaos if someone takes him out.

His generals could destroy Seoul in a matter of minutes if the signal was given.

However, it seems likely that a plan like that has at least been discussed at the highest levels.

Trump seems to be making some good progress on the diplomatic front. Let’s see how that goes.
