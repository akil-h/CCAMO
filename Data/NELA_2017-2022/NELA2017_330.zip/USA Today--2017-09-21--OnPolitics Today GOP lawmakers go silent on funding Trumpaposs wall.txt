President Trump is determined to squeeze $1.6 billion out of Congress for his would-be signature border wall. But lawmakers in his own party? Eh, not so clear.

The Senate's yet to tackle the $1.6 billion in initial wall funding that the House approved in July. That could come amid a budget battle in December, when the federal government's current funding is set to run out.

The USA TODAY Network asked GOP lawmakers whether they backed the wall funding. Three said no and 69 said yes. The vast majority, though — 219 — refused to take a stance or offered radio silence.

No matter, though. Mexico's still plans to pay for the wall, right? No ..?

What would the wall entail? Thirty-plus journalists talked to farmers, families, tribal members and even a human smuggler as they traversed the entirety of the U.S.-Mexico border. They wrangled property records and analyzed government maps along the way to see what securing a 2,000-mile border would mean.

USA TODAY Network's The Wall lets you explore Trump's border wall through words, sounds, images — even virtual reality.

Will Trump kill the nuclear agreement with Iran? He knows, but won't say. Remember how he teased his Supreme Court pick for days to build suspense? It's that, but this time with a deal Trump on Tuesday called "one of the worst and most one-sided transactions" in history. He has until Oct. 15 to declare his decision on the deal, which eases nuclear sanctions on Iran. In return, the nation gives up making nuclear weapons.

Quitting the deal would "destroy" America's credibility, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said from the U.N. podium on Wednesday, calling Trump's remarks "ignorant, absurd and hateful." France's president also urged Trump to stick with the deal to avoid another "North Korea situation."

And speaking of North Korea, Trump blamed that whole thing Wednesday on — who else? — Hillary Clinton.
