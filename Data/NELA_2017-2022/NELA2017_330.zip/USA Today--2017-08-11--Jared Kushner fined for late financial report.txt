Trump son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner was fined for a late reportÂ of a financial transaction, according to a report from McClatchy.

Kushner, who has divested assets in order to work at the White House, reportedly was fined $200 by the Office of Government Ethics. Per McClatchy, such reports are considered late if they're filed more than 45 days post-transaction. The fine comes after a 30-day grace period.

It's rare for such fines to be assessed, the report noted. Last year, more than 12,000 periodic transaction reports, which are notifications that employees have bought or sold stocks or other assets, were filed. Of those, only 3.6 percent received late fees.

The report also noted that 17 other White House officials filed their personal financial disclosures late, including former chief of staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Office of Public Liaison communications director Omarosa Manigault.

Watchdog groups told McClatchy such behavior was a sign that ethics wasn't a priority for the administration.
