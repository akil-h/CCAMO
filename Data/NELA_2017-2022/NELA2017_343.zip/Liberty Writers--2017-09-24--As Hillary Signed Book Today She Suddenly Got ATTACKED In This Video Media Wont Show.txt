It happened again. Hillary Clinton was signing her books this Saturday – when conservative journalist Laura Loomer crashed another Hillary Clinton book signing.

Jefferson Lee then screamed, “Bill Clinton is a rapist!” right after he greeted Hillary and shook her hand. Security then quickly shut her out. Watch the astounding video below.

Laura Loomer then tweeted out something even funnier. She said that the Secretary Service giggled.

Here is another angle of the event.

Share this if you are so tired of seeing Hillary, although you got to admit that it is hella funny to see her on her loser apology tour.

Get this out there, embarrass them.
