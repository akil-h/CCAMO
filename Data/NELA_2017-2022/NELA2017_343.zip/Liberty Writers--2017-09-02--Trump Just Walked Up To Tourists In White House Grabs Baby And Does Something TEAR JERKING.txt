President Trump surprised visitors to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on Thursday. He walked into a room flanked by Secret Service members and made a beeline to a mother that handed him over.

The crowd chanted, “We love you!” What Trump said next is wild.

The president smiled when he heard the chants that said “God bless you, Mr. President!”

He kissed the baby and then said “Enjoy the White House, everybody.”

The video was posted by Welsh tourist Sacha Davies and was posted with the following caption: “Hey Guys I met @realdonaldtrump.”

Trump is often seen kissing babies. He is no stranger to fatherhood. This is why we love him. He is an amazing President that is fighting every single for our country to be better.

We cannot let him fight alone. Please share this if you are proud to have President Trump and don’t believe for a second all the lies that the media tells about him.
