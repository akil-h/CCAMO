Dr. Gary Shilling, the president of A. Gary Shilling & Co., spoke to Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget, about the process of working off the excesses that built up in the 1980s and 1990s, and breaks down a market forecast he nailed several years ago. He says that we haven't seen income growth, which is putting a lot of pressure of politicians to do something. While monetary policy hasn't done the trick, he predicts that massive fiscal stimulus is in the cards, and says that it's the one thing in the Trump agenda that's actually going to happen.
