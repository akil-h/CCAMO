Bengaluru: Satishkumar A, a techie in Bangalore did something which has not happened before. He wrote a full-fledged novel about 300 pages in one stroke while waiting at the silk board signal to clear up.

He emailed the soft copy to one of the well-known city publisher, Kasirajan, who came over to meet him on the way at kadubeesanahalli signal. The novel was so well written the publisher approved it after doing a brief negotiation on royalty payment.

We met Mr. Satishkumar on the way to office at kundalahalli gate to know more about his ‘unique’ achievement. Here is what he has to say. “I am travelling on the same route every day from Electronics city to Whitefield. With full four hours at my disposal, on top of it when it rains you can add couple of more hours more, what one can do sitting inside office cab? I watched so many movies, big lengthy ones like gangs of wasseypur, all Ashutosh Gowariker ones. 1 TB data of movies got over in two months, after that got bored”, said Satish.

He added, “Tried new stuff like dhinchak Pooja videos, GoT old episodes. Then I thought with role models like Chetan Bhagat to follow, why not try a novel. Luckily for me unlike Bhagat who takes 2 years to write a novel, it took me just 2 hours. Do not go by the short time it took, it has all the ingredients to be a best seller and as well as it can be adapted for a block buster movie”
