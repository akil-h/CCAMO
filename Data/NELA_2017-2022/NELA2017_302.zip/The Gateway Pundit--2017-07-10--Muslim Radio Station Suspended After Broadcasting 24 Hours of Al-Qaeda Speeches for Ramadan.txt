A British Muslim radio station was suspended after airing 24 hours of Al-Qaeda speeches.

The speeches were broadcast for the holy month of Ramadan.

Russia Today reported:

A British radio station has been suspended after it broadcast more than 25 hours of lectures by a suspected Al-Qaeda recruiter during Ramadan that called for “holy war” and “encouraged violence.”

The Office of Communications (Ofcom) has temporarily revoked the license of Sheffield-based Iman FM for playing lectures by radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, a hate preacher who was killed by a US drone strike in 2011.

Ofcom said it received a complaint from a listener in June. When contacted by the watchdog, the radio station said it decided to broadcast a series of pre-recorded lectures during Ramadan as the regular presenter was not available.

In one, Awlaki said, “prepare whatever strength you have for holy war in the cause of Allah. This is a form of worship,” according to the Daily Mail.

Imam FM told Ofcom it searched the internet for lectures “on the life of the Prophet Muhammed” and “lectures on Seerah,” adding that the lectures it broadcast were “freely available.”
