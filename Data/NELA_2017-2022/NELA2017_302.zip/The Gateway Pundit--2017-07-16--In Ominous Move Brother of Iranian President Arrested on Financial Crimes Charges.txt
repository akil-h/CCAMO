The brother of the Iranian president has been arrested on Sunday, kicking off an ominous start to Rouhani’s second term. Little is known about what prompted the surprise move, which may be interpreted as Rouhani tightening his grip over Iran.

“Multiple investigations have been conducted regarding this person, also other people have been investigated, some of whom are in jail,” spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said in a televised press conference.

“Yesterday, bail was issued for him but because he failed to secure it he was referred to prison,” Ejei added. He said Fereidoun would be released “once he provides the bail.”

Fereidoun is also a top aide to President Rohani, a relative moderate who changed his surname from Fereidoun years ago.

Fereidoun has long been accused by Iran’s hard-liners of financial crimes and corruption. He has reportedly been linked to officials at the center of a scandal involving inflated salaries for managers of a state insurance company.

Fereidoun, who is also the president’s aide, has long been accused by the conservatives of financial crimes and corruption.

In January, a group of Iranian parliamentarians called for Fereidoun to be put on trial for economic crimes, a move critics described as politically motivated.
