Dr. Milton Wolf is a board-certified diagnostic radiologist in Kansas. The good doctor is also President Barack Obama’s second cousin, once removed. Dr. Wolf ran for the US Senate against Senator Pat Roberts in 2014 and narrowly lost to the longtime senator in the GOP primary.

This weekend Senator John McCain had surgery.

 The senator’s office called the procedure routine.

Dr. Milton Wolf tells The Gateway Pundit the media is covering for John McCain.

The mainstream media is covering for McCain or they’re just completely clueless. Or both. He had brain surgery for a 5 cm intracranial hematoma. That’s a big deal. Can be life ending. Media is buying his statement that it was from a routine annual physical —brain surgery?!— and they’re saying it was “above the left eye” rather than saying brain. Clintonesque.

Dr. Wolf posted several tweets on the seriousness of Senator McCain’s condition.

“A five centimeter hematoma is huge.”

The hematoma could have been caused by blood thinners, stroke, or tumor.

John McCain is in a more serious situation than the media is reporting.
