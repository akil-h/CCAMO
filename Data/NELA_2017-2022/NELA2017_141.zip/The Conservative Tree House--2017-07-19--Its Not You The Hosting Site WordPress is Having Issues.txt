Sometime around midnight EDT WordPress must have released a corrupted update code or something because 100% of the comments are going into moderation.

It’s not anything commentators are doing wrong, and it’s not something we can correct on the admin side.  I’ve no idea what the problem is.

WordPress has these “glitches” from time to time, usually when they release some kind of code or make some kind of update change to the platform.

Hopefully it will auto-correct soon or WordPress engineers will notice what they’ve done.  In the interim we are releasing comments from moderation as quickly as it can be done.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
