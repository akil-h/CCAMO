While the left fulminates about "foreign interests" interfering in our political system, can I ask why an Irish leftist whose job was apologizing to the UN for the existence of the United States was able to get access to the private conversations of hundreds of Americans?

Samantha Power, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was 'unmasking' at such a rapid pace in the final months of the Obama administration that she averaged more than one request for every working day in 2016 – and even sought information in the days leading up to President Trump’s inauguration, multiple sources close to the matter told Fox News.  Two sources, who were not authorized to speak on the record, said the requests to identify Americans whose names surfaced in foreign intelligence reporting, known as unmasking, exceeded 260 last year. One source indicated this occurred in the final days of the Obama White House.

What that means is that normally Americans are protected from being eavesdropped on. Unmasking exposes the names of Americans in conversations. It's supposed to be done only rarely. And there's no reason why a UN ambassador should have been able to unmask one name, never mind hundreds of them.

1. Deny everything, as Susan Rice did,

2. Then admit something, but blame Russia, as Susan Rice and her media cronies did

3. Wave off the idea that there's anything improper about large scale eavesdropping on Americans.

Hope and Change. This is what it always looks like, whether in the USSR, in China or in American. It may be tactless to say this, but if you elect Communists, you get Communism. And that doesn't just mean a major drop in living standards, constant media propaganda and a cult of personality.

It also means a knock at night and an agent of the state listening to your conversations.
