Remember when the Liberal Outrage of the Minute was Valerie Plame. The same fake scandal machinery went into motion. The outing of Plame, a non-undercover figure, was supposed to be the worst crime ever committed and would lead to the impeachment of Bush. (Sound familiar?)

Then Obama Inc. casually outed the CIA Station Chief in Afghanistan and the New York Times outs CIA people whenever they become politically inconvenient.

The article is, "C.I.A. Names New Iran Chief in a Sign of Trump’s Hard Line.” The CIA official's name is being censored here. The New York Times however printed it in full.

"The C.I.A. declined to comment on Mr. _____ role, saying it does not discuss the identities or work of clandestine officials. The officials spoke only on the condition of anonymity because Mr. _____ remains undercover, as do many senior officials based at the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Va. Mr. Eatinger did not use his name. The New York Times is naming Mr. _____ because his identity was previously published in news reports, and he is leading an important new administration initiative against Iran."

So the Times admits that their target is undercover.  They're naming him because he's leading an "initiative against Iran". The Times, like every Democrat who voted for Obama's dirty Iran deal, supports Iran. And so it's deliberately undermining our national security in support of an Islamic terror state.

That's treason. And the Times should be held accountable for it.
