Here's the video we're talking about. You've probably already seen it. It's gone viral because it shows a wonderful human moment.

If Obama had done it, you know what the coverage would be like.

The media has to cover viral videos because it's in competition with them. That means it has to spin a video of President Trump replacing a marine's cover. Can it do it? Of course it can.

Obviously this was not and is not the way that Newsweek and the media cover viral photos and videos of Obama. Here's a typical headline... "Adorable photos of 6-month-old meeting Obama go viral"

It's not. "Adorable photos of 6-month-old meeting Obama go viral and Liberals are loving it."

Things lefties like are deemed universal. Things conservatives like are factional. This is an ongoing theme in media bias. Watch for it and you'll see it everywhere in the culture war. Their habits and mores are normalized. Everyone else's are marginalized.

But then we go into straight out negative spin.

"Donald Trump is definitely not without his critics, but it would seem that even his acts of kindness face their challenges. The US President was seen attempting in vain to replace a marine’s hat after it blew off in strong winds."

And yes, the media can provide negative spin for anything.
