On the heels of Barack Obama Day, in which the bankrupt state of Illinois celebrated the economic policies that inspired it, it's time for Colin Kaepernick Day.

What has Colin Kaepernick done to deserve a Day? Well he hates America and he's a Black Nationalist. These days that's enough. And as no team wants him and the 50% loss in home game crowds he would bring, it's time to give him some recognition.

Sure he can't play football. But he does hate that America. So it's a perfect time to transition Colin Kaepernick from football player to civil rights icon. And since these days civil rights is just code for Black Nationalist racism, it's an easy transition.

Will this come before or after Light rail, mandatory homeless housing in all duplexes, free crack dispensaries in all Target stores, universal health care and the death penalty for anyone carrying plastic bags?

Either you get boycotted by Sharpton's hate groups, whose members don't actually attend games unless it's Pogrom Day, or by actual Rams and Chargers fans. #AllFansMatter

That's a lot cheaper than paying Colin millions to drive away Rams fans.

He certainly has. So has the KKK. I don't think the Rams are honoring them either.

Yes, and Orange County doesn't need the LAPD to stop gang members from shooting little kids. The inner city does.

The protests will continue until Sharpton gets a consulting gig with the Rams. And then with every team that fails to hire Colin. At least somebody's cashing in on him. #Resistmuchwemustandwillcashin

Aside from actually being good at sports. But Colin probably is as good of a quarterback as Muhammad Ali is. Today.
