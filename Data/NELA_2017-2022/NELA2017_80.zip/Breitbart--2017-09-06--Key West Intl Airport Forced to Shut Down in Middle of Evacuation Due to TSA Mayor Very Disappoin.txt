Earlier on Tuesday, the Monroe County, FL Sheriff’s Department issued an evacuation order for the entire county, which includes Key West.

Those unable to take one of the few remaining flights out of Key West will have to evacuate by automobile and rely on U.S. Highway 1 from Key West to the Florida mainland as the only available route.
