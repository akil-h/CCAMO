Replying to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s statement on World Refugee Day, Ivanka Trump attempted to send her own message recognizing the over 22 million refugees around the world. However, complicit in her father’s administration that is decidedly hostile toward refugees, Twitter did not take kindly to her empty rhetoric.

Donald Trump has tried multiples times – all unsuccessfully – to implement a travel ban that would block all refugees from entering the United States for 120 days. Ivanka, who has branded herself as a “moderating” voice in the White House, has thus far failed to influence any policy whatsoever, much less to “moderate” Trump’s extremism.

While Ivanka continues to feign tolerance, she should take care not to throw her own father under the bus in the meantime.

Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!
