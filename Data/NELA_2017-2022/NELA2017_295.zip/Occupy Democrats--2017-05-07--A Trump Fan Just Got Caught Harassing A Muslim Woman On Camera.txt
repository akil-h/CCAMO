A Trump supporter waiting in line at a Trader Joes grocery store in Reston, Virginia was in the middle of a tirade against a Muslim woman when she realized she was being filmed. Her tone changed instantly.

The video starts in mid-confrontation between a Muslim woman and a white woman. After the white woman lobs a few insults at her, the Muslim woman states that she should not have let her in front of her in line. The white woman retorts that she “wishes they didn’t let [her] in this country.”

The Muslim woman corrects her, saying, “Excuse me? I was born here.”

There is a long pause before the white woman re-launches into her xenophobic rant:

This was the last straw for the already too patient Muslim woman, who reprimands the white woman for her complete and utter lack of social aptitude. It is at this moment that the white woman sees that she is being recorded and a look of panic flashes across her face.

The Muslim woman continues explaining that it is not “normal” to “strike up” a conversation like this at a grocery store. The white woman, dumbfounded, can only reply smugly, “What set you off? Obama?” before the video cuts out.

The damage for the white woman, of course, is already done. Yashar Ali, a journalist for Mother Jones, The Daily Beast, and New York Magazine, has already posted the video to his nearly 80,000 followers and the video has been retweeted about 15,000 times in search of the white woman’s identity. Furthermore, a local NBC affiliate has picked up the story.

While certain racists may feel emboldened by Trump, racism has no place in today’s America. Those who try to push the limits will, sooner or later, be exposed for exactly who they are.
