Vandals struck a highway exit sign in New York, adding three letters that are sure to have Hillary Clinton supporters in an uproar.

While we certainly aren’t in the business of condoning vandalism in any form, you have to admit this is pretty funny.

The Crooked Hill Road exit on the Sagtikos Parkway on Long Island was altered with the addition of three simple letters. Can you guess what they were?

Via the New York Daily News:

A sign marking the Crooked Hill Road exit off a New York parkway has been altered to read “Crooked Hillary,” officials said. The defaced traffic sign on the Sagtikos Parkway on Long Island was reported to the State Department of Transportation Wednesday, Newsday reports. The letters “A,” “R” and “Y” were pasted to the end of the word “Hill.” The sign was corrected the same day. “As soon as we were notified about the graffiti yesterday morning, it was removed,” a Department of Transportation spokesperson said. “Defacing public signs is illegal.”

‘Crooked Hillary’ was the nickname given to Clinton during the 2016 presidential election by Donald Trump, stemming from her classified email scandal.

Clinton served as senator in New York between 2001 and 2009, and easily carried the far-left state against Trump. It’s a bit of a surprise to see such a prank pulled on Clinton in this area.

While the DOT was quick to fix the ‘Crooked Hillary’ sign, there is no word on whether or not they used Bleachbit to remove the letters, or whether they simply wiped them away “like, with a cloth or something.”
