A few hours after Steven Mnuchin unveiled the Trump administration's tax reform proposal, the White House sent out a transcription of the briefing... with one kind of big typo in it.

"Briefing by Secretary of Commerce Steven Mnuchin and Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn," the subject line read.

The problem: Mnuchin is the secretary of the Treasury. Wilbur Ross is the secretary of Commerce (as the White House staff knows, since it sent out on Tuesday a transcription of a briefing featuring Ross).
