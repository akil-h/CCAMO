A French beekeeper  and avid cannabis user spent years researching how to bring these two important parts of his life together.  The result is a natural nectar being called “cannahoney.”

The 39-year-old Frenchman has come to be known as Nicolas Trainerbees.  He has earned this nickname over the past 20 years and has happily adopted the name as he is proud of his association with animals and bees.  He has spent so much time with his insect friends that he claims he can actually train them to behave as he wishes.

“I have trained bees to do several things, such as collect sugar from fruits, instead of using flowers”.   He has been working with “cannahoney” producing bees for some time now, but gives the real credit to the bees, stating he simply uses a “training technique whereby the bees collect the resin and use it in the beehive”.

It was at the request of friends and followers that Nicolas decided to train his bees this way.  He had been studying bees for long enough that he knew the potential result could be a great success.  “For some time, I had known about the health benefits of bee products such as honey, propolis, pollen, wax and royal jelly and also about the benefits of cannabis”, he explains.

“Everything that passes through the body of a bee is improved… So if the bee took the resin from cannabis it would also be very beneficial… The aim arose for me to get the bees to obtain this resin”, he reflects.

After several years of testing, he finally began producing results he was happy with, in 2013. He says its terpenes have “a delicious and pleasant taste” that have aromas of a fresh plant.

“Cannahoney” usually has “quite a floral” aroma and a colour that slightly changes from light green to white or yellow.  Nicolas says it  “is not smoked, it is ingested and it is good for health.”
