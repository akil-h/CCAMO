This photo was taken yesterday at Stoney Fork Creek, in Bell County, Kentucky, downstream of a Revelation Energy coal mine.

Revelation Energy is the same company that operates the strip mines adjacent to Kanawha State Forest that have caused widespread water pollution.

Revelation is owned by Jeff Hoops of Milton, West Virginia, who has made millions destroying mountains and streams in West Virginia and eastern Kentucky.

The blood red color is caused by Potassium Permanganate (a water treatment additive) mixed with acid mine drainage.

This is getting zero coverage by the mainstream media.

Help spread the word if you believe WATER IS LIFE!
