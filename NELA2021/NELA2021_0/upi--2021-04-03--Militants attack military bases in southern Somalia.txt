April 3 ( UPI ) -- The militant group Al-Shabab attacked Somali military bases in the country 's Lower Shabelle region early Saturday , according to military officials .
VOA News reported that around 4 a.m. Saturday , the group attacked military bases in Barire and Awdhegle in southern Somalia .
Abdulaziz Abu Musab , the leader of the al Qaeda-linked group 's military wing , has claimed responsibility for the attacks and said they killed 47 government soldiers and confiscated equipment and ammunition , Bloomberg News reported .
Somali Army chief Brigadier General Odawa Yusuf Rageh has denied this forces foiled the attack and killed `` dozens of terrorist militants . ''
The country 's defense minister later told state television the government killed about 100 militants while defending against the attacks .
Officials said the attackers started with suicide car bombs on both bases , then followed with infantry attack .
