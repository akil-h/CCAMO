AUSTIN ( The Borowitz Report ) —Texas Governor Greg Abbott said that he was “ actively considering ” additional measures to prevent people from wanting to ever set foot in the state .
Although he acknowledged that new laws banning most abortions , restricting voting , and allowing citizens to carry a gun without a permit or training would dissuade many from visiting Texas , Abbott said that “ there ’ s more we can do.
” “ Maybe we pass a law that says when you have to go to bed every night , or when you ’ re ” he said .
“ We need to put our thinking caps on.
” “ Just spitballing here , but what if we mandated that every visitor to Texas got bitten by a dog or poked with a stick of some kind ?
” he said .
“ I ’ ll be damned if that wouldn ’ t do the trick.
” Even as he works overtime thinking up with new ideas to alienate potential visitors to Texas , he admitted he was surprised that anyone still wanted to come .
“ Honestly be enough to keep people out , ” he said .
