Jussie Smollett , the drug-addicted , anti-white , anti-Trump celebrity who cried wolf , was convicted last week on five out of six felony counts of disorderly conduct after falsely reporting to Chicago police that he was a victim of a hate crime attack in the sub-zero morning hours of Jan. 29 , 2019 .
Let us revel in the criminal comeuppance of a Hollywood liar .
It ’ s rarer than spotting a pair of MAGA redneck viewers of the liberal , anti-cop black TV drama , “ Empire , ” at 2 a.m. in downtown Chicago .
LOL s a breaking news update in perpetuity : Smollett ’ s two phantom conservative white assailants â who somehow recognized the C-list actor and somehow knew he was gay and somehow just happened to be carrying around a “ noose ” along with a hot sauce bottle filled with bleach â are still on the loose .
The fictional fugitives have gone the way of the “ real ” killer of Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman , the racist gang rapists who assaulted Tawana Brawley and the white supremacist who hung that door â in NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace ’ s garage .
It ’ s getting rather crowded in the liberal theater of manufactured racism .
I know .
I ’ ve been documenting the twisted phenomenon for 30 years , since my days at the hate crime hoax-hotbed of Oberlin College .
But there ’ s an important loose end , hanging limply like the rope around Smollett ’ s neck , that deserves more scrutiny : Where in the world is the Obamas ’ Chicago fixer and Jussie fangirl Tina Tchen ?
Let actor is .
Two months after Smollett and his bodybuilding bro buddies play-acted their fantasy attack , Chicago Sun-Times reporters discovered that deep-pocketed Obama campaign finance mega-bundler Tina Tchen had inserted herself in the investigation .
Tchen texted Cook County State ’ s Attorney Kim Foxx just three days after the incident “ on behalf of Jussie Smollett and family who I know ” to express “ concerns.
” She suggested that Foxx lean on Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson to yield to the FBI , and she shared an unidentified Smollett family .
Foxx texted back that she had done as requested and that Johnson was “ going to make the ask.
” The unidentified relative rejoiced : “ OMG this would be a huge victory.
” As I reported at the time , the ties between Tchen and the Smollett family run deep : â Tchen and Smollett ’ s sister , Jurnee Smollett-Bell , joined together in March 2018 at South by Southwest in Austin to proclaim that “ There Is No Time ’ s Up Without Women Of Color.
” â In the stage together againâ hand-in-hand , glued at the hip â at the United State of Women Summit in Los Angeles ( where Tchen ’ s former boss and gal pal , Michelle Obama , also appeared ) .
â Smollett-Bell and another sister , Jazz Smollett-Warwell , worked for the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012 and volunteered as tireless surrogates .
â My search of White House visitor logs shows Jurnee Smollett-Bell paying at least one personal visit to “ POTUS/FLOTUS ” at their residence in March 2013 while Tchen was Obamas .
Since I wrote “ Culture of Corruption ” in 2009 , I ’ ve tracked Tchen ’ s political maneuverings in the Democrat Deep State : â Tchen personally shoveled more than \ $ 200,000 into the 2008 Obama presidential campaign coffers while a high-powered lawyer at white-shoe Skadden Arps .
â Tchen served as special assistant to President Obama and then took over as chief of staff in the East Wing for Mrs. Obama .
â Tchen headed up the Obama White House Office of Public Engagement , spearheaded by Valerie Jarrett .
â Tchen coordinated Hollywood celebrities to promote Obama ’ s domestic policy agenda through the taxpayer-subsidized National Endowment for the Arts .
â Tchen was listed in 2009 White House visitor logs I reviewed as having met there with radical left-wing billionaire George Soros , and as Breitbart ’ s Joel Pollak noted , Soros donated a total of \ $ 408,000 to super PACs supporting Foxx ’ s successful primary and general campaigns for Cook County state attorney .
There ’ s another set of related loose ends , know , and did they instigate Tchen ’ s meddling in Smollett ’ s folly ?
Remember : Michelle Obama hosted Jussie Smollett at a musical event at the White House in 2016 and danced with him on stage at a College Signing Day Event in 2018 .
I consider them all unindicted co-conspirators in the Smollett Swindle .
And they should pay .
Tchen has disappeared from public view since her fiasco with the # MeToo movement .
She was forced to resign from the board in August after being exposed for and accused sexual harasser Creepy Andrew Cuomo .
I reached out to her for comment this week on the Smollett verdict and for her expert legal opinion as a high-powered lawyer on whether there be legal consequences for aiding and abetting a convicted hate crime hoaxer .
No response .
I have a feeling I ’ ll be waiting longer than O.J .
Simpson ’ s victims for an answer .
