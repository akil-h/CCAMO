Disgraced Andrew Cuomo abandoned the New York governor ’ s mansion last week , leaving nearly 15,000 dead nursing home residents in his wake as a result of a catastrophic executive order forcing their facilities to take in COVID-19-infected patients .
He also left behind a bevy of female underlings with a mountain of sordid sexual harassment allegations .
And , reportedly , Cuomo also ditched his poor dog , whom two state troopers claim he tried to pawn off to any willing taker .
But that ’ s not all .
In the dark of night , safe from granted clemency to one of the radical left ’ s most notorious anti-cop convicts â a man whose family ’ s elite privilege I ’ ve chronicled for the past 19 years .
David Gilbert is the Weather Underground domestic terrorist sentenced to 75 years-to-life in prison for his role in the infamous 1981 Brink ’ s robbery in Nyack , New York .
Gilbert and his wife , Kathy Boudin , were leaders in the 1960s group of rich-kid agitators who bombed government buildings and corporate headquarters and aided convicted felons in chauffeurs for the Black Liberation Army robbers who held up a Brink ’ s truck at a Rockland County mall and stole more than $ 1.6 million .
Two of the holdup victims gunned down in the botched Brink ’ s robbery were police officers .
One was a private security guard .
All three were military veterans from working-class backgrounds .
As I ’ ve noted previously in my columns dating back to 2002 , Gilbert and Boudin ’ s abandoned son , Chesa , is the pampered Rhodes Scholar and now has faithfully whitewashed his biological parents ’ crimes ( and those of his unrepentant adoptive parents , Weather Underground poster couple Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn ) .
Celebrating the clemency order this week , Chesa Boudin claimed that his father “ never intended harm.
” Gilbert was defiant at trial and has called himself a “ political prisoner ” for the entirety of his 40-year imprisonment , which he has spent advising Black Lives Matter leaders and other fledgling Marxist militant groups .
Gilbert called the deadly shootings and robbery “ revolutionary explained , the domestic terrorist crimes were “ aimed at supplying financial support for the Black Revolutionary Army , a militant spin-off from the Black Panther Party.
” Reminder : In 1973 , Black Liberation Army/Black Panther member Joanne Chesimard ( “ Assata Shakur ” ) shot and killed New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster execution-style during a traffic stop .
The gunfight also left her brother-in-law , Black Liberation Army leader Zayd Malik Shakur , dead .
At the time , the Black Liberation Army had been tied to the murders of country .
Chesimard , Zayd Shakur and another member were wanted for questioning in the murder of two of those cops when they were stopped .
Chesimard was convicted and sentenced to life in 1977 but escaped from prison two years later with help from violent left-wing accomplices .
One of those thugs , Black Liberation Army killer Tyrone Rison , admitted to participating in a series of armored-car robberies , including a $ 250,000 heist in the Bronx on June 2 , 1981 , that left a Brink ’ s guard dead in the planning of the Brink ’ s robbery in which Boudin said his father and mother meant “ no harm.
” I remind you , again , as I have for the past two decades , that police officers Waverly Brown and Edward O ’ Grady and Brink ’ s guard Peter Paige were murdered during the homicidal siege .
Brown , who served in the Air Force after the Korean War , had two grown daughters and a teenage son .
O ’ Grady , who served in the Marines and , left behind a wife and three children â 6 , 2 and 6 months old .
Paige , a Navy veteran , also left behind a wife and three kids â 19 , 16 and 9 .
