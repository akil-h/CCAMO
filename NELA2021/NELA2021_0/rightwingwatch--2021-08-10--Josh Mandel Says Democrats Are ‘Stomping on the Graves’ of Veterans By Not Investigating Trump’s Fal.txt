During his recent appearance on “ The Pete Santilli Show , ” Ohio Republican U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel called for the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol to be “ completely abolished ” and replaced with a commission to investigation how the 2020 election was supposedly stolen from former President Donald Trump .
Mandel said that by failing to investigate the alleged voter fraud , Democrats are “ stomping on the graves ” of veterans who died fighting for this country .
“ I actually came out and called on the U.S. abolish this Jan. 6 commission , ” Mandel said .
“ I don ’ t think we should have a Jan. 6 commission .
I think it ’ s a waste of taxpayer time , it ’ s a waste of taxpayer money , and I think we should replace it with a Nov. 3 commission .
If Congress wants to spend time investigating something , they should investigate the fact that this election was stolen from Donald Trump.
” “ As a Marine Corps vet , ” Mandel added , “ when in elections—they ’ re not only disenfranchising their neighbors , they ’ re stomping on the graves of every Marine , soldier , sailor , airman who ’ s paid the ultimate sacrifice so we can live free , so we can have that right to vote every November .
And so I think this whole Jan. 6 thing … it ’ s a total waste of time , and as I said , we should replace it with a commission to investigate the real crime , which was the stealing of the I believe that Trump won the election .
