In case you hadn ’ t heard , Vice President Kamala Harris ’ venture into government space propaganda for children was a galactic bust .
The veep ’ s smarmy performance in a NASA agitprop video touting World Space Week was universally ridiculed and exposed this weekend after a local Monterey , California , TV station interviewed one of five child actors who auditioned for roles in the YouTube production .
Canada-based Sinking Ship Entertainment ( does it get any better than this ? )
cast and oversaw the scripted special for YouTube Originals , which the New York Post the U.K. called it “ cringe-worthy.
” It was phony-baloney on steroids ( or maybe one too many mimosas , judging from Harris ’ tipsy delivery ) .
But there ’ s so much more to the story .
What the “ Get Curious With Vice President Harris ” clip really shows is how deep the incestuous ties between the Biden-Harris ( mis ) administration and Google/YouTube run â and why every parent should be very wary about allowing their children to be exposed to GooTube ’ s commie-style programming masquerading as educational example , that the creative executive and producer for YouTube Originals is a veteran Obama-Biden operative , consultant on the Biden-Harris administration ’ s vaccine education campaign , and close former aide of Michelle Obama ?
YouTube Originals ’ staffer Lauren Vrazilek tweeted last week that she “ had a blast ” making the Harris video .
She tagged four top Harris staffers in her tweet : VP communications director Ashley Etienne , VP digital strategist Brenna Parker , VP director of press operations Peter Velz and VP personal aide Opal Vadhan .
video last week , tweeting that Harris invited “ five kids from around the country to her residence at the Naval Observatory to learn about space and be inquisitive.
” He called it “ super cute , ” but failed to mention that the young performers were not just naturally “ inquisitive , ” but had all been auditioned beforehand to ensure they could ask Harris questions on cue .
For those who are , ahem , curious , Vrazilek served as former first lady Michelle Obama ’ s media consultant on her .
Prior to that , the YouTube Originals creative director and producer worked for the Obama White House for nearly six years as an intern , director of correspondence , associate director of digital engagement , and deputy press secretary to Mrs. Obama .
When Biden-Harris took office in January , Vrazilek exulted on Twitter : “ Apparently when you don ’ t work in DC people expect you to work on Inauguration Day ?
I had a bowl of ice cream and a cry before 8am â the chances of me doing Madam Vice President Harris are slim to none.
” “ Slim to none ” are also the odds that parents can rely on YouTube to provide anything other than slanted brainwashing to their kids .
Google/YouTube ’ s parent company , Alphabet , forked over \ $ 21 million to Democrats in 2020 .
The revolving door between Google and White House Democrats is notorious .
In April 2016 , the Campaign for Accountability tracked 61 Google or Google-tied employees leaving the tech conglomerate to take federal government jobs and 171 Obama-Biden staffers Even more insidiously , you must remember that GooTube has repeatedly violated children ’ s privacy : â Google/YouTube admitted to data mining children ’ s emails without consent and in violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act .
â In 2019 , the Federal Trade Commission levied a \ $ 170 million fine against Google/YouTube over its violation of the federal Children ’ s Online Privacy Protection Act .
â Last September , Google/YouTube was slapped with a massive class-action lawsuit in the U.K. accusing “ the platform of routinely by unlawfully targeting up to five million under-13-year-olds with addictive programming and harvesting their data for advertisers.
” Lawyers for families lambasted the Silicon Valley giant in their announcement , claiming execs and employees “ know full well that millions of children watch YouTube .
They ’ re making money from unlawfully harvesting data about these young children as they watch YouTube videos â and then running highly targeted adverts , designed to influence vulnerable young minds.
” Truly curious journalists in the Beltway might want to know more about how many more working intimately with Biden/Harris to pump out political programming for young online addicts whose data is being mined , monetized and weaponized by the manufactured-reality managers of Big Tech .
