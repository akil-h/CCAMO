Liberal media outlets are finally calling out President Biden and his administration over their handling of the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico southern border .
The Biden administration blaming COVID-19 for denying the media full access to the migrant facilities appears to have failed and media outlets are outraged because of the blackout .
Border officials are under White House orders to scale back on direct contact with the media which are requesting tours of the facilities and the opportunity to take photos to report on their findings .
While there ’ s been a surge of illegal migrants at the the liberal media are now starting to criticize President Biden and his administration over the lack of transparency .
A news report by CNN criticizing President Biden included a description on the lower third of the screen , saying , “ Biden fails to deliver on border transparency promise.
” MSNBC host Katy Tur said the lack of media access is “ very frustrating , ” and asked , “ Why is the media still not allowed into these facilities ?
” “ As long as you have a permissive immigration policy , crisis at the border , ” he said .
And yes , we have United States Senators from Connecticut , Democrats , liberals , that are talking about tears in their eyes , when they look at the situation that these children are in .
That ’ s a crisis !
At the border !
” Liberal media outlets didn ’ t hesitate to criticize former President Trump over the southern border which highlights a clear double standard .
President Biden ’ s White House press secretary Jen Psaki continues to deflect and ’ s failed immigration policy along the U.S.-Mexico southern border is a disaster and it ’ s about time the liberal media outlets call him out over a crisis of his own making .
