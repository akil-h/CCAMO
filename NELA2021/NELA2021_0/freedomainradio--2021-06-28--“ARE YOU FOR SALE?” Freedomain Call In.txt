“ ARE YOU FOR SALE ?
” Freedomain Call In My dad left when I was very young .
I have 3 other siblings and we ’ ve all seen him visit pretty rarely .
At first it was once a year .
Now that we ’ re all adults we ’ ll maybe see him once every few years .
I ’ m getting married in two months and I called him up to personally invite him .
I didn ’ t want to but I felt I had to .
However , he ’ s married to an s done horrible things to my sister .
I informed him that since I wanted my sister to have a good time at our wedding that his wife wasn ’ t invited .
I haven ’ t heard from him since .
My grandma apologizes for his behaviour constantly and is still trying to get him to come .
But personally I ’ d rather she didn ’ t .
Fatherlessness has had clear disadvantages that I still deal with today but I wonder if his example would really make me a better not having a father ?
How do I make sure I ’ m the best possible parent for my future kids without an example to look up to ?
