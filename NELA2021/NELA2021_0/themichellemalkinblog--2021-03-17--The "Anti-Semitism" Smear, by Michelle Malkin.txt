Everything you need to know about the fair-weather “ friends ” of the First Amendment can be found by examining the phonies on the left and right who hurl reckless charges of “ anti-Semitism ” to stigmatize and silence their political foes .
Texas Gov .
Greg Abbott , a Republican , viciously employed this odious tactic last week against the free speech platform , Gab.com , and its 4 million users .
Flanked by two GOP state legislators sponsoring a bill to support a state-supported Holocaust and genocide commission , he declared , “ Anti-Semitic platforms like Gab have not represent Texas values.
” This is the same presidential aspirant who just two weeks ago had launched a Lone Star state war on Big Tech censorship .
In a widely covered press event , Abbott called Silicon Valley ’ s deplatforming of conservatives “ un-American , un-Texan , and unacceptable.
” That declaration followed an earlier proclamation signed by Gov .
Abbott to protect free speech on college campuses : Abbott ’ s whiplash-inducing pivot “ makes no sense , ” Jewish online activist and Gab user Amy Mek of the RAIR family were doxxed by left-wing operatives for her outspoken criticism of Islamic sharia law and terrorism .
Hounded by the Southern Poverty Law Center and Huffington Post , and suspended by Twitter for her peaceful political speech , she found a welcoming community at Gab .
“ I support this Christian-run business , ” said Mek .
And I “ thank them for creating a free-speech platform.
” Jewish journalist and “ most banned woman in the world ” Laura Loomer voiced similar support : “ As a free speech platform , the most offensive speech to exist on its platform is a testament to its commitment to being a true free speech platform.
” So , why did Abbott demonize this “ digital Noah ’ s Ark ” ( as devout Christian founder Andrew Torba describes it ) for censored conservatives and dissidents â especially when every liberal Big Tech platform has banned the former president of the United States ?
First , follow the money .
Torba notes that while Abbott trashes Silicon Valley for clicks and cable TV hits , he ’ s campaign donors ) like Tesla , Oracle and Hewlett Packard to move to Texas .
Then , there ’ s the pander factor : Independent journalist and lawyer Glenn Greenwald reported that Abbott was “ the prime cheerleader for a bill in Texas â ultimately ruled unconstitutional â to ban the state from hiring anyone who refuses to pledge support for Israel ( by promising not to privately boycott them ) .
He ’ s an enemy of free speech.
” The Israeli government has lobbied governors and state legislatures across America to .
That ’ s not “ America First.
” Finally , there ’ s the power play .
The Texas Republican Party itself has a verified Gab account and backs the platform .
The state party is led by Abbott ’ s chief political rival and enormously populist party chairman , Allen West .
What better way to neutralize a potential primary challenge than to detonate the nuclear “ anti-Semitism ” bomb ?
As Nick Fuentes , AFPAC organizer and “ America First ” host , put it : “ Gab vs. Abbott litmus test.
” He ’ s now banned from almost 30 platforms , including YouTube , DLive and Clubhouse , over the very same trumped-up charges of “ anti-Semitism ” wielded against Gab and Torba .
Last week , the mere mention of his name as a hashtag was banned on TikTok and Instagram : “ I am being systematically erased from the digital world and with me goes the possibility of meaningful dissent against the political establishment in America.
” We ’ re all in this together .
When I accurately called , ” the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League Jonathan Greenblatt railed that I was using “ a term that right-wing extremists and white supremacists use as a codeword for ‘ Jew . '
” When I named several Soros-subsidized , tax-exempt nonprofit “ charities ” flooding our country with illegal immigrant criminals and cheap labor while on my “ Open Borders , Inc. ” book tour , Media Matters of America ( itself a Soros-backed hate machine ) accused me of deploying a “ common anti-Semitic trope.
” When I documented the vast to dump hundreds of thousands of refugees across America ’ s heartland , Media Matters blared in a headline that I pushed an “ anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that motivated Tree of Life synagogue shooter.
” When I stood up for intelligent and polite young men on college campuses who challenged Turning Point USA speakers about their defense of open borders , green card giveaways , unconditional foreign aid to Israel and the bombing of the USS Liberty , I was denounced by establishment conservatives as insane , fame-seeking , money-grubbing , white supremacist-flirting and , of course , “ anti-Semitic.
” My Jewish husband got a huge chuckle out of all of that .
And it goes on .
When I spoke at the first American First Political Action Conference last year and pointed out how “ anti-Semitism ” had become a “ useless , meaningless term and everybody knows it , ” the Jewish News Syndicate gathered all the shrill shills ’ demands to “ shun ” and “ disavow ” me under the headline : “ Conservatives rebuke Malkin for questioning what is ‘ and debating are not acts of “ anti-Semitism.
” They are acts of honest journalism and patriotism .
The smear machine can and will be defeated by a united front of dissidents who preach and practice Gab ’ s motto â “ Speak Freely ” â without fear or apology .
