Panama ’ s Foreign Minister Erika Mouynes alerted the U.S. about another massive wave of Haitian migrants headed to the U.S. , saying , “ We sounded the alarm when we should have.
” It ’ s estimated thousands of mostly Haitian migrants are heading to the U.S.-Mexico southern border .
Mouynes appeared frustrated that the warnings from Panama are being ignored by the Biden administration .
Mouynes also said over 85,000 Haitians made their way through Panama earlier this year .
New York Post reports Mouynes ’ government alerted the Biden administration in advance of the flood of illegal .
Erika Mouynes claimed in an interview with Axios that her government had notified the White House of the most recent migration surge , which culminated in more than 15,000 people gathering under a bridge in Del Rio , Texas and waiting to be picked up by border authorities earlier this month .

President Biden ’ s job performance over his failed border policies is plummeting with Texans .
Biden was put on notice about the U.S. and he is not acting to stop them .
In fact , by allowing the majority of Haitian migrants that entered Del Rio , Texas illegally to stay in the U.S. , Biden is sending an open borders message to the world .
Biden ’ s failure to address the crisis at the border is both a public health and national security risk and provides additional evidence he is failing at his job to protect Americans .
