A report on the Capitol Police response to the January 6th riot found the department made disastrous errors in judgment including ignoring intelligence that warned of trouble at the Capitol .
The report , “ Review of the Events Surrounding the Jan. 6 , 2021 , Takeover of the U.S. Capitol , ” by Inspector General Michael Bolton for the Capitol Police found the department was aware the Capitol was at risk .
The Capitol Police had clearer advance warnings about the Jan. 6 attack than were previously known , including the potential for violence in which “ Congress itself instructed by their leaders not to use their most aggressive tactics to hold off the mob , according to a scathing new report by the agency ’ s internal investigator .
Despite intelligence that warned of pending violence three days prior to January 6 , a day before the riot they said there were “ no specific known threats related to the joint session of Congress.
