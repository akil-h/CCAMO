Dr. Anthony Fauci , chief medical adviser to President Biden , laughed off a question about being investigated by the Department of Justice during an interview aired on Sunday November 28 .
Fauci is also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health .
When the interview on “ Face the Nation ” turned to the politicization of science and public health , Fauci went on offense .
First , Fauci criticized Senator Rand Paul ( R-KY ) and soon after he went after Senator Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) .
that Cruz wanted the attorney general to prosecute him .
Fauci reacted by laughing saying , “ I have to laugh at that .
I should be prosecuted ?
What happened on Jan. 6 , senator ?
” In October during a Senate hearing , Cruz told Attorney General Merrick Garland he should prosecute Fauci for lying to Congress over statements he made regarding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan virology laboratory .
Fauci believes he is being made into a scapegoat and added , “ I ’ m just going to do my be saving lives and they ’ re going to be lying.
” While Fauci claims he is just a scientist doing his job , his comments attacking the Senators totally undermines his assessment of himself .
Attacking Senators and calling them liars is very political and shows he is very defensive of his role in funding gain-of-function research in China .
Fauci has lost credibility in the eyes of many Americans and after his comments on CBS News , he should be fired .
