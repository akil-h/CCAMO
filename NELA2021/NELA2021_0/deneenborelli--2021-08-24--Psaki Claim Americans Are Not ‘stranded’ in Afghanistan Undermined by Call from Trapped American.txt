White House press secretary Jenn Psaki pushed back on the comment that Americans “ are stranded ” in Afghanistan during Monday ’ s press conference .
However , in less than 24 hours , Psaki ’ s statement was proven false by an American trapped in Kabul .
“ Does the president have a sense that most of the criticism is not of leaving Afghanistan ?
It ’ s the way that he has ordered it to happen by pulling the troops before getting these Americans who are now stranded .
Does he have a sense of that ?
” Doocy asked .
Psaki quickly grew defensive and told Doocy that saying Americans “ are stranded ” in Afghanistan is “ irresponsible.
” Psaki ’ s claim was undermined by a call from an American that is trapped in Kabul .
A woman called Fox News ’ Fox & Friends First where she aired the desperate situation .
She said she is worried for her life and added the communications from The State Department is inconsistent .
Psaki isn ’ t the only one in the Biden administration being challenged over the serious fact-checked President Biden ’ s press briefing lies about the conditions on the ground in Afghanistan .
Biden attempted to put a positive spin on the developments in Afghanistan and address criticism about his withdrawal strategy .
After his address , Biden took questions from the media from a pre-approved list .
ABC News wrote a fact check following Biden ’ s remarks and his answers to questions from the media .
Fox News ’ Jennifer Griffin had trouble keeping up with Biden ’ s false statements .
The attempts by Psaki and dire situation in Afghanistan are grossly misleading , dangerous , and reckless .
Given the lack of accurate information coming from Biden and his team , it ’ s not surprising to see his public approval rating falling like a rock .
