CALIFORNIA ( The Borowitz Report ) —Despondent after yesterday ’ s recall election , millions of California Republicans are fleeing the state for Florida and Texas in search of dumber governors .
The Republicans are choosing to leave their lives in California behind rather than put up with another year and a half of a governor who oppressively follows science .
Harland Dorrinson , a real-estate agent in Orange County , said that he was leaving for a new life in Florida with little more than the Rolex on his arm .
“ I looked at myself in the mirror under the tyranny of a governor who blindly adheres to verifiable reality ?
” he said .
“ I decided I ’ d be better off with Ron DeSantis.
” Although he is excited about starting over in the Sunshine State , Dorrinson said that choosing between Florida and Texas was “ one of the toughest decisions ” of his life .
“ With Governor Abbott and Governor DeSantis , you really can ’ t go wrong , ” he said .
“ Both of them oppose mask mandates .
Both of them actually had his videos banned from YouTube for spreading COVID misinformation .
That was the tiebreaker for me .
