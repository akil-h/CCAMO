UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ( The Borowitz Report ) —In what is being called a widespread e-mail scam , millions of Americans have been tricked into sending money to a person claiming to have been elected President in 2020 .
According to Harland Dorrinson , who heads up the National Internet Scam Bureau , the person sending the hoax e-mails claims to have had an election stolen from him and to be in desperate need of cash .
“ The e-mails look very official , so it ’ s not surprising that so many people have been taken in , said that those receiving the e-mails should take a close look at the sender ’ s name .
“ The actual President of the United States is named Joe Biden , ” he said .
“ If the name of the person on the e-mail is something different , then it ’ s a fake.
