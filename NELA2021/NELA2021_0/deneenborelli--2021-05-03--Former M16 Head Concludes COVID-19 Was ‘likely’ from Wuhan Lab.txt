Sir Richard Dearlove , a former head of the United Kingdom Secret Intelligence Service , believes it ’ s “ far more likely ” COVID-19 origin was from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China .
Dearlove made his comments on Leading Britain ’ s Conversation , a talk radio station based in the United Kingdom .
The former spy chief criticized the recent report organized by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and called it a “ farcical investigation.
” According to the WHO report , the virus came from nature .
Dearlove said “ it ’ s where it could have reached humans via an animal but given what he knows , he concluded the more likely scenario was it was a result of some sort of laboratory manipulation .
WHO adviser Jamie Metzl also told the radio station that a “ full , unrestricted ” investigation is called for .
Dearlove ’ s views somewhat match concerns raised in a U.S. State Department fact sheet on the origins of COVID-19 .
The U.S. government does not know exactly where , when , or how the COVID-19 virus—known as SARS-CoV-2—was not determined whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan , China .
However , former CDC Director Robert Redfield also believes the virus came from the laboratory .
A new article in Medium discusses the laboratory hypothesis including the possibility that the National Institute of Health funded the creation of the virus .
Clearly , we don ’ t have proof that COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology but the weight of the evidence is pointing in countries must unite and demand a full investigation into the origins of COVID-19 .
Keep in mind , the WHO report claimed the virus was natural but it did not find an animal that carried COVID-19 that then could have passed it to humans .
Based on what I ’ ve read , I ’ m with Redfield and Dearlove and believe the pandemic is from the Wuhan Institute of Virology .
