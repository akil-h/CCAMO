Stefan Molyneux : THE RATIONALIST MANIFESTO !
My response at age 23 to the Communist Manifesto When I was 23 years old , I wrote a ferocious response to The Communist Manifesto .
In this document , I unpacked all of my philosophical beliefs , tracing moral arguments all the way from theories of reality , the validity of the senses and the epistemology of reason – to my fledgling theory of ethics , which many years later turned into Universally Preferable Behaviour .
I shared this document by mail debates to improve its contents , and now , at the ripe old age of 54 , I go back 31 years to review my thinking as a young man .
This document is a true treasure in the history of philosophy , because it shows where my thinking was over three decades ago .
Over the course of almost 2 and half hours , I read through the document , analyze my historical thinking , and compare it to where I stand now .
Purchasing the NFT gets you access to the and analyzing the text , as well as a PDF of the original Rationalist Manifesto , which I have not touched or edited since I finished it so many years ago .
Reading this document has given me a deep appreciation of where I started , and how far I have come – I hope that you find it is fascinating and illuminating as I do in understanding what I got right , and what I got totally and completely wrong !
