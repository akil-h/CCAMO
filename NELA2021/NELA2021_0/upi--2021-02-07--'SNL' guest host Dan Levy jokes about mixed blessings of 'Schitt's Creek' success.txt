Feb. 7 ( UPI ) -- Actor and writer Dan Levy joked about the success of his comedy Schitt 's Creek while he was hosting this weekend 's edition of Saturday Night Live .
`` The last 12 months have quite literally changed my life in so many ways , both good and not so good , '' Levy told the audience in his opening monologue .
`` Some good : people finally started watching our show Schitt 's Creek .
We were fortunate enough to win nine Emmys this year .
Unbelievable .
Beyond a dream come true , so good : those Emmys were quite literally thrown at us by a stranger in a HAZMAT suit .
The good : I have been getting stopped on the street by all different kinds of people , which is new and fun and different .
The not so good : those people are mainly screaming , 'Ew ! '
at me , which was a line I wrote for the show that will now haunt me for the rest of my life . ''
Levy also appeared in a sketch about friends ( Redd and Heidi Gardner , ) who gather for a Super Bowl party and boast about how careful they have been playing it during the coronavirus pandemic .
Sitting in a living room , they take off their face masks and reveal they have been traveling , wrestling , shopping , eating in restaurants , having unsafe sex with strangers and carrying a vaccine around in a vial instead of actually taking it .
The segment ended with the pals eating chili out of a communal pot with their hands and realizing they Loss of taste and smell can be symptoms of the coronavirus .
SNL cast member Kate McKinnon then showed up as Dr. Anthony Fauci and said : `` What you just saw was the wrong way to Super Bowl .
That 's why I partnered with Cheetos and Durex condoms to remind you to Super Bowl responsibly -- at home , in a mask , lights off , no friends . ''
