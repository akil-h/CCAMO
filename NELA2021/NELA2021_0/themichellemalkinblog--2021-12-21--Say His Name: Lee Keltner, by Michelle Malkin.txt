Dear Lee : I never had a chance to meet you .
But I will never forget you â and I will do my best to ensure that you are not forgotten .
As the owner of Crossfire Hats in Brighton , Colorado , your craftsmanship and artistry were renowned â and you garnered local media attention for your success for over two decades in the highly specialized business .
You told one interviewer that your work making custom cowboy hats was “ keeping the West alive , one hat at a time ” and that your products represented the said you were a “ country boy ” who “ love ( d ) being an artist.
” Your friend and fellow hatter Steven Weil , owner of Rockmount Ranch Manufacturing Company , told KDVR 31 News that Lee Keltner was “ a Western guy , he followed the cowboy code.
” He praised you as “ a man of integrity ” and “ honest person.
” You were a beloved grandfather and father .
Your sister Suzan noted that you “ served our country ” as a U.S. Navy veteran .
Your that would give you the shirt off his back ” and a “ patriot.
” You were a family man , a self-made entrepreneur and artisan , a motorcycle enthusiast , and a salt-of-the-earth American who took pride in his community , his craft and his country .
My kind of people .
On Oct. 10 , 2020 , you headed to Denver ’ s Civic Center Plaza to attend a “ Patriot Muster ” â a peaceful gathering of citizens hosted by Benghazi Marine hero John “ Tig ” Tiegen to show Glory and Thin Blue Line flags , donning MAGA hats , joined you .
Young and old , civilian and military , able-bodied and wheelchair-bound , answered Tiegen ’ s call to “ Stand Up and Show Up.
” The rally went off smoothly â until attendees began to disperse and return to their cars .
Tiegen ’ s men had come trained and prepared to defend their supporters after the violent Back the Blue rally that I attended three months earlier in July 2020 with hundreds of others at the very same violent antifa and Black Lives Matter vigilantes wielding metal rods , skateboards and megaphones to threaten and assault law-abiding citizens .
Remember : The Denver police union president Nick Rogers blew the whistle on how top brass ( led by a police chief who marched arm in arm with BLM this summer ) issued a retreat order while the mob trampled our constitutional rights to free speech and peaceable assembly .
But despite Tiegen ’ s preparation , better police presence and barriers that kept rioters from invading the plaza , one man : Lee , you weren ’ t able to see or know that an agitator named Jeremiah Elliott had been antagonizing your fellow patriots throughout the end of the event as they walked back to their cars .
From multiple pieces of video footage and from witness accounts I gathered , Elliott was menacing and hateful .
He had a history of left-wing agitation , including leading an anarchist antifa/black bloc mob outside a Denver police station a month before the Patriot Muster .
As I previously reported , Lee , while Elliott radical named Matthew Dolloff and a local NBC affiliate investigative producer for Denver ’ s 9News named Zack Newman conferred with each other nearby .
At some point , Dolloff handed his cellphone to Newman .
Minutes later , photographers and videographers filmed the agitator aggressively daring Keltner to deploy a can of bear spray he was holding to protect himself as Dolloff and Newman stood by closely .
At first , Lee , you resisted engaging in any physical brawl as the agitator escalated .
Mere seconds later , you walked away into what appears to be a deadly ambush with Dolloff .
In an instant , Dolloff appeared to grab for something on your chest while you slapped defensively at his face .
Dolloff then immediately whipped out a gun and shot at your face as you sprayed the repellant in self-defense .
I repeat the questions I asked in the aftermath of what I believe was a media-political assassination , Lee , so they and you will not be forgotten : What did Newman and Dolloff discuss as they shadowed you and Elliott ?
Did Newman or Dolloff know Elliott ?
Was Newman , who works for a station that routinely demonizes conservatives as violent racists while whitewashing the left-wing trashing of downtown Denver , aware of Dolloff ’ s extensive social media footprint calling Trump supporters “ racist ” “ fascists ” and posting “ Rise Up ” Communist revolutionary propaganda ?
Lee , your friend Steven Wright , who was with you in your last waking moments , continues to push for truth and justice in your case .
He told me recently : you , Michelle.
” Steven said you told him that “ no one will hurt her again ” and that the riot at the July “ Back the Blue ” event “ had a significant impact on me and Lee Keltner.
” Lee , I will never get to say “ thank you ” to you .
But I vow in 2022 to make sure that “ never again ” is your legacy and that your name and courage are not forgotten .
God bless you , patriot .
