WELLINGTON , OHIO ( The Borowitz Report ) —Holding his first campaign-style rally in months , an out-of-practice Donald J. Trump forgot to strand the event ’ s attendees in a parking lot Saturday night .
Blaming the failure to strand the rally crowd on “ rustiness , ” a member of Trump ’ s inner circle apologized for not delivering a signature feature of Trump rallies .
“ People have come to expect that , at the conclusion of one of our rallies , they will be marooned in the middle of nowhere for hours , often in inclement Trump aide , said .
“ On Saturday night , we didn ’ t get it done.
” Dorrinson said that the entire Trump team would be conducting a postmortem of the rally to find out why attendees were able to leave the event without incident .
“ Saturday night was our first rally in a long time , and we weren ’ t in fighting shape , ” Dorrinson said .
“ But that ’ s no excuse .
I want to promise all future attendees : if you come to a for hours afterward with no buses anywhere in sight—period .
