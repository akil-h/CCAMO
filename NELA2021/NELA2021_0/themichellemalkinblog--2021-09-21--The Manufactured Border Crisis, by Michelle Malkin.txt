In nearly 30 years of covering America ’ s corrupted immigration and entrance policies , I can tell you definitively that every “ border crisis ” is a manufactured crisis .
Caravans of Latin American illegal immigrants don ’ t just form out of nowhere .
Throngs of Middle Eastern refugees don ’ t just amass spontaneously .
Boatloads of Haitians don ’ t just wash up on our shores by random circumstance .
All the world ’ s a stage , and as I exposed in my most recent book , “ Open Borders , Inc. , ” the than expedient tools to globalist elites , profit-maximizing corporations , self-aggrandizing religious and nonprofit groups , and criminal smuggling syndicates .
That ’ s how the so-called border crises under former Presidents Bill Clinton , George Bush , Barack Obama and Donald Trump all played out .
The players are always the same : United Nations operatives , U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbyists , the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and its sovereignty-undermining shelter operators around the world , Jewish and evangelical Christian refugee resettlement contractors , international drug cartels , human traffickers It ’ s the same old , same old under President Joe Biden .
The latest wave of Haitians traversing rough seas and barren deserts to trespass onto U.S. soil at our southern border in Del Rio , Texas , is no accidental phenomenon .
Todd Bensman , senior national security fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies , has been interviewing Haitians at Ciudad Acuna , Mexico , the town through which an estimated 15,000 of these illegals have passed to form the massive encampment in Del Rio , Texas .
Several , Sept. 12 , the Mexican government effectively sent a mass of migrants it had bottled up for months in its southern states up to the American border .
This move , which appears to have been done under the cover of Mexico ’ s independence week of celebration known as El Grito , essentially foisted a humanitarian problem onto the Americans in a single week.
” Several Haitians told Bensman that government officials in Tapachula informed them they no longer needed passports or other paperwork they had been waiting months for â grace period to make their rush for the border .
Because Ciudad Acuna and Del Rio are not as infested with Mexican cartel enforcers , thousands of Haitians took advantage of the relatively safe passage into America ’ s promised land without having to pay the usual coyote fees .
Most have been lying in wait in Chile and Brazil for several years looking for better economic opportunities , so don ’ t believe sob-story propaganda that the prime factor has to do with any recent natural disaster or sudden political turmoil .
Policy Institute himself tweeted that “ for those wondering about where Haitian migrants are coming from , most left Haiti in 2010-12 after the earthquake and settled in Brazil .
… Later most moved to Chile & Ecuador .
… This means that most of those arriving in Texas have been out of their country for about a decade .
The Covid recession , discrimination , and the perception that they could get into the US now all played a role in the movement north over the past few months .
… Both transit through the Darien Gap in July/August suggesting significant movement north.
” Countless Catholic parishes , like the Franciscan parish in Necocli run by Father Henry Lopera , have facilitated Haitians ’ migration through the Darien Gap and onto Mexico and the U.S. by supplying food packages .
Doctors Without Borders has three health posts to assist the trespassers .
Along the way , these Haitian invaders have also been assisted by the United Nations ’ International Organization of Migration , which has dispatched minibuses filled with toiletries and hair ties , according in “ Open Borders , Inc. , ” the International Organization of Migration , or IOM , is the same agency that signed “ cooperation agreements ” in Mexico with three migrant shelters along its southern border to assist border-busting “ irregulars ” traveling through the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca on their way to the U.S .
The IOM pact guaranteed supplies of medicine , hygiene products , construction materials , therapy services and legal training at the Hermanos en el Camino shelter , along with the Catholic-run Hogar de la del Pobre y el Migrante shelter .
IOM extended similar aid to nine other migrant shelters in the northern and central parts of Mexico , from Chihuahua , Sonora and Tamaulipas along the northern border to San Luis Potosi , Veracruz and Tlaxcala in the center of the country .
Who ’ s paying ?
Funding for IOM ’ s operations comes from the U.S. State Department ’ s Bureau of Population , Refugees and Migration , which is subsidized by y-o-u .
The bozos in the Biden administration are now play-acting with ” of Haitians .
But I ’ ve seen this show and all its reruns over the past three decades before .
It ends with sneaky “ temporary protected status ” orders , mini-amnesties and maxi-amnesties to feed the global Open Borders , Inc. beast .
All the world ’ s a stage , and America is the overrun doormat being trampled upon while our own citizens suffer increasing deprivation and anarcho-tyranny .
Ain ’ t “ diversity ” grand ?
