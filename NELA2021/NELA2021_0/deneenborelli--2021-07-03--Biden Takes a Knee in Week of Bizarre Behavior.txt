President Biden had a series of bizarre behavior this week while in the public eye .
On Friday , the 2020 World Series Champion Los Angeles Dodgers were honored by Biden and Vice President Harris at the White House .
Strangely , Biden felt the need to take a knee for the group photo .
Biden also bungled the name of Dodgers ’ pitcher Clayton Kershaw .
Biden held a press conference to comment on Friday ’ s June jobs report but was asked several questions by reporters about American troops leaving Afghanistan .
Visibly annoyed about the Afghanistan topic calling their questions “ negative ” and that he only wanted to discuss “ happy things.
” While in Florida this week , Biden bizarrely suggested global warming as a potential contributing factor in the collapse of the Florida condominium .
Biden met with Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis , toured the site , and visited with the families of the victims .
During press remarks , Biden claimed many of the family members speculated part of the reason for the collapse was global warming .
After a week of bizarre behavior , s handlers make every effort to keep him out of the public eye .
