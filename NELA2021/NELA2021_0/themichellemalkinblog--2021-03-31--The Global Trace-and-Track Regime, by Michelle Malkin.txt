The Biden administration ’ s vaccine passport scheme is just the teeny-tiny tip of a massive privacy invasion iceberg .
A year ago this week , I began chronicling the worldwide weaponization of COVID-19 by big government and big business to trace and track the health data of untold hundreds of millions of human beings .
Let ’ s review .
In March 2020 , Singapore unleashed a Bluetooth app called “ TraceTogether ” on Google Play and the Apple Store to track people who tested positive for coronavirus and notify others through their cellphones .
For those who argue ” bear in mind that Singapore functions as a high-tech dictatorship where refusal to comply with stay-at-home orders and refusal to share GPS location data with health bureaucrats are criminal offenses subject to six months ’ imprisonment and/or a $ 10,000 fine .
The Singapore system was quickly expanded to require users to submit their national ID numbers and passport numbers ; a few months later , the government issued wearable tracing “ tokens ” with QR codes to all 5.7 million residents in Singapore .
Plans are in the works to formally , restaurants , workplaces , schools and shopping malls .
Dozens of states , plus countries including Germany , the U.K. , and a large swath of Canada , now use COVID-19 exposure notification apps akin to Singapore ’ s that are built on Google and Apple ’ s Exposure Notification application programming interface .
On March 9 , 2020 , the Trump administration ’ s U.S. Department of Health and Human Services unveiled new data rules requiring doctors and hospitals to “ send a core set of medical data directly to third-party information exchange.
” Google , Apple and Microsoft â all at the forefront of health data mining â sat in on the rule-making process meetings .
The tech oligarchs are in the driver ’ s seat , not the back of the bus .
As I ’ ve reported in investigative documentaries and this column for years , Google/YouTube is already knee-deep in mental-health data mining of adults and children despite repeated privacy violations .
They ’ ve mined students ’ emails in violation of the federal Family and Educational Rights and Privacy federal Children ’ s Online Privacy Protection Act .
Google secretly harvested tens of millions of medical records with identifying names , lab results , diagnoses , immunization records and prescriptions from thousands of hospitals across 21 states through “ Project Nightingale ” â a partnership with Ascension health system to build a search tool and data analytics using machine-learning algorithms .
A year ago this month , Google launched “ Verily , ” a COVID-19 screening and testing website .
California Gov .
Gavin Newsom forked over $ 55 million to subsidize contracts allow Google/Verily to mine and share home addresses and medical information with “ unnamed contractors and state and federal health authorities , ” according to Kaiser Health News .
In April 2020 , COVID control freak Anthony Fauci mentioned that the feds had begun investigating “ certificates of immunity ” for American citizens .
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio launched a snitch line urging people to upload photos of businesses not in compliance with social distancing rules .
Georgia officials dispatched law enforcement officers to random private homes in Fulton about their health and to collect blood samples for an antibody test .
Police agencies in Florida , Connecticut and New Jersey deployed drones to enforce social distancing and experiment with fever and facial mask detection .
In May 2020 , China rolled out temperature armbands to college students .
In August 2020 , the Butler , New Jersey , public schools mandated temperature armbands manufactured by Accwell for students and staff to be worn at all times as a condition of access to public education .
Volan Technology successfully marketed and distributed beacons ” to school districts that can track campus movements of COVID-positive wearers for up to 30 days and identify others with whom they ’ ve had close contact .
Princeton Identity rolled out new touchless biometric and iris scanning products to be installed on college campuses .
Online proctoring services that proliferated in the age of COVID , including Proctorio , Factorial and Respondus Monitor , collect college students ’ facial recognition data â which can be sold to third parties .
This week , the Washington Free Beacon obtained a Biden developed by the University of Illinois using Bluetooth technology that mimics the Singapore model I flagged a year ago .
This week , snoozing Americans finally woke up to the Biden vaccine passport plan and the New York vaccine verification program known as the “ Excelsior Pass.
” But these credentialing systems have been in the works for years among U.S. and global health agencies , long before “ corona ” meant nothing more than a beer or bright light to most people .
The Vaccination Credential Initiative is a joint endeavor of Salesforce , the Mayo Clinic , electronic medical records giant Epic , Big Pharma CEOs and globalist nonprofit entities all coordinated by the military-industrial powerhouse MITRE corporation .
These public-private partnerships between tech companies and Surveillance States obliterate any meaningful distinction between “ free market ” initiatives and government directives .
Big tech , big health and big government all work seamlessly to ensure the success of the global trace-and-track regime .
There is no freedom to choose in a climate of collusion and a culture of conformity .
