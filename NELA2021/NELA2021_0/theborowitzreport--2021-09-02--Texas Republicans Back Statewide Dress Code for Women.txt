AUSTIN ( The Borowitz Report ) —A new bill moving swiftly through the Republican-controlled Texas legislature would institute a strict statewide dress code for women .
Governor Greg Abbott , a vehement supporter of the bill , said that the dress code would benefit women because “ it will give them one less thing to think about when they get up in the morning.
” “ I believe in the sanctity of human life , and the best way to protect that life , in the case of a woman , is to free her from the stress of having Abbott said .
Abbott summarized the new dress code , which bars women from wearing skirts above the knee , sleeveless blouses , and most varieties of pants .
“ Slacks are fine as long as they have cuffs , ” he said .
“ However , if a woman is caught wearing jeans or dungarees , she will be sent home.
” Abbott dismissed comparisons between the state ’ s proposed dress code and that imposed by the Taliban , which has required women to wear burqas .
“ We are strongly ” he said .
