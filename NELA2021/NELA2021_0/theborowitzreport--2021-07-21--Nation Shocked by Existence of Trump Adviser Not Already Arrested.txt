NEW YORK ( The Borowitz Report ) —Millions of Americans were shocked to learn of the existence of a Trump adviser who had not already been arrested .
In interviews across the country , Americans who had been certain that there were no unindicted Trump advisers left said that the arrest of Tom Barrack had caused them to rethink things .
“ After Manafort , Stone , Flynn , Bannon , Cohen , Papadopoulos , and the rest , I really thought they ’ d gotten them all , ” Tracy Klugian , who lives in Phoenix , said .
” “ Trump sure had a lot of advisers charged with crimes , ” Harland Dorrinson , who lives in Chattanooga , said .
“ Whoever hired advisers for him did a terrible job.
” Carol Foyler , who lives in Akron , saw a silver lining in the Trump adviser being arrested so late .
“ Since Giuliani already lost his law license , Barrack doesn ’ t have to worry about being represented by him , ” she said .
Davis Logsdon , who lives in Minneapolis , had previously thought remaining to be arrested but is no longer sure .
“ Jared and Don , Jr. , haven ’ t been arrested yet , ” he said .
“ Or have they ?
It ’ s so hard to keep track .
