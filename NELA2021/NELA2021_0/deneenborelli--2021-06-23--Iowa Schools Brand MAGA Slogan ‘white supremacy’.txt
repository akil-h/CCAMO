Johnson reports that hundreds of educators have been forced to to participate in the training , which will be taught to children across the district next semester .
The leaked information included a pyramid called “ Examples of Racism Across Levels.
” Earlier this month , Iowa Republican Governor Kim Reynolds banned Critical Race Theory in schools in effect July 1 .
“ This is indoctrination not education , ” Reynolds said of CRT .
“ And it ’ s exactly why concepts and critical race theory in Iowa schools .
Kids need to be taught how to think and not what to think.
