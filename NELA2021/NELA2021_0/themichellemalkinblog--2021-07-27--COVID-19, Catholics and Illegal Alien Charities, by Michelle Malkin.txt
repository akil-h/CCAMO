It seems there ’ s no sanctuary from draconian mask and vaccine mandates .
You can ’ t get on a plane , go to school , work at a hospital , perform onstage , compete in sports , exercise at a gym , worship in church or walk outside without the long shadows of Big Pharma and the COVID-19 control freaks looming over every aspect of your lives .
Every breath , every movement , every tweet , every Facebook post , every Instagram meme is being monitored for compliance .
There is one escape hatch , however .
, congratulations !
Privileged border trespassers have been handed special “ Get out of COVID Tyranny ” cards , while the Biden administration is poised to send vaccine squads door to door to harass law-abiding citizens .
Immigration rules don ’ t apply to illegals , and neither do the invasive pandemic rules imposed on our citizenry .
Fox News reporter Bill Melugin reported on Tuesday that “ after an incident at a Whataburger , police in La Joya , ( Texas , ) say they ’ ve learned illegal immigrants who test federal custody to a local Catholic charity in the ( Rio Grande Valley , ) which then places them in local hotels without notice.
” Border Report , a publication of Nexstar Media Group , also discovered that Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley , or CCRGV , had placed illegal aliens at a local hotel that “ reportedly did not contain them inside their rooms .
The La Joya Police Department issued a public health warning citing reports that visibly sick migrants had been at a burger joint not wearing masks.
director Sister Norma Pimentel , who told the outlet that the situation “ has been corrected ” and “ a security guard was hired at the hotel to keep the migrants inside.
” It is unknown how many COVID-19-positive illegals have been housed at hotels in Texas , but the federal government ’ s outsourcing arrangement with Catholic Charities has been in place in the Rio Grande Valley since at least May 2014 .
I interviewed former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent Victor Avila in April about illegal alien-coddling activities at untold numbers of border trespassers onto buses or planes without IDs ( try doing that , my fellow Americans ! )
.
Avila also told me he saw envelopes being handed to the illegal aliens at the Catholic Charities facility , which he believed to be cash .
Catholic Charities certainly has money to burn .
As I reported in my 2019 book , “ Open Borders , Inc. , ” Catholic Charities raked in an annual revenue of nearly $ 4 billion in 2016 , $ 1.2 billion of which came from largest single source of funding for Catholic Charities , comprising more than one-third of its total funding .
Operating under the umbrella of the illegal alien amnesty-promoting U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , Catholic Charities employs an estimated 65,000 employees engaged in affordable housing , health , welfare , employment , and immigration and refugee resettlement .
In 2016 alone , Catholic Charities ’ members served 413,050 immigrant and refugee clients .
Immigrants ( no distinction is made between legal and illegal ) received help with “ Dreamer ” applications , detention and services .
Refugees received “ interpreter services , job placement , employment training , outreach , counseling , legal services , and matched savings programs.
” As I warned in my book , what every Catholic who believes in a sovereign America needs to understand is that the radicalized leaders of Catholic Charities are using your collection-plate contributions to implement Marxist-inspired liberation theology principles ; think of it as faith-based socialism for a borderless planet .
What every taxpayer needs to know is how much of this Catholic largesse for open borders has one Washington Times estimate , some 57 government agencies now contract with the Catholic Church .
From the federal Corporation for National and Community Service in 2016 , for example , Catholic Charities agencies scooped up $ 14 million .
That year , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provided the largest infusion of tax dollars , followed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development , U.S. Department of Agriculture and other major agencies .
The federal funding includes both direct government grants as well as “ pass-through ” federal grants to other state and local entities or nonprofit groups ( including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ) .
Catholic Charities has also reaped unknown financial and in-kind contributions from governmental and intergovernmental agencies ranging from the European Union to the United Nations to the governments of Austria , Australia , Canada , Columbia , El Salvador , Germany , Honduras , Sweden , Switzerland , the U.K. and the World Bank .
It ’ s bad enough the multibillion-dollar illegal alien racket run by Catholic Charities puts “ welcoming the ’ s own homeless , jobless , veterans , Native Americans and poor .
But for federally funded Catholic Charities and Biden officials to work together to undermine our borders and open our doors to hordes of maskless COVID-19-carrying trespassers flouting our laws â as we citizens suffer under unceasing pandemic oppression â is unholy treachery .
