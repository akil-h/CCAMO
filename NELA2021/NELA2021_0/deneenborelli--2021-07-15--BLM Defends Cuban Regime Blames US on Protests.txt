Black Lives Matter issued a statement on social media defending the Cuban regime while blaming America over the protests in the streets .
Cubans took to the streets to protest against their communist government , however , Black Lives Matter praised the communist regime and demanded the U.S. end sanctions against Cuba saying it ’ s a “ cruel and inhumane policy.
” Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio posted a series of videos showing the Cuban regime going door to door threatening and harming Cubans .
Rubio also slammed the media for distorting the reason for the Cuban protests .
Mercedes Schlapp passionately talked about her father who was imprisoned under Fidel Castro .
Black Lives Matter is on the wrong side of freedom .
Of course , that is not surprising given its founder believed in Marxism .
Based on their words and actions , Black Lives Matter doesn ’ t really support black lives because its activism is directed at black lives when they are taken by a white police officer .
In contrast , Black Lives Matter is radio silent about black-on-black crime .
With their defense of the Cuban Matter doesn ’ t care about freedom-loving Cubans either .
