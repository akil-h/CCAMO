Should a peaceful , law-abiding man of faith be punished in perpetuity for publicly proclaiming his heartfelt belief that âALL LIVES MATTERâ¦EVERY SINGLE ONEâ ?
The question is not merely rhetorical .
It is now a legal matter for a California court and jury to decide .
Grant Napear , radio talk show host and former announcer for the Sacramento Kings basketball team , filed a lawsuit last week against his former employer , Bonneville International Corporation , after the Utah-based media conglomerate threw him under the bus last spring to mollify the un-mollify-able Black Lives Matter mob .
In lunatics across America lost their minds over the Minneapolis police-involved death of career criminal and drug addict George Floyd .
Coast-to-coast riots caused nearly \ $ 2 billion in damages and cost scores of livesâall under the guise of âsocial justiceâ and âpeaceful protest , â of course .
Those who dared stray from BLM orthodoxy â no joking allowed , no defense of law enforcement allowed , nothing less than full and immediate genuflection to the vengeful gods of âdiversityâ allowed â faced moral condemnation , social media persecution , and even punishments .
His crime ?
In response to NBA player Demarcus Cousinâs tweet to him asking âwhatâs your take on BLM ?
â , the veteran sports journalist answered with those fateful six words : âALL LIVES MATTERâ¦EVERY SINGLE ONE.â A tsunami of hate and smears ensued on social media .
Another NBA player , Matt Barnes , gleefully tarred Napear as a âcloset racistâ and stoked a backlash .
Barnes had pre-existing grudges against Napear , who had called him out over a night club brawl that led to criminal charges against , among other unruly incidents .
âPlain and simple , â Napear told me in an interview on Monday , âMatt called me a closet racist on Twitter to get back at me .
The sad thing is his tweet was taken as judge and jury .
If I ’ m a closet racist , why did you come on my show every week and ask to play in my golf tournament ?
This is just part of the sad cancel culture that exists in our country now.â Within 48 hours , corporate KHTK , fired the 62-year-old veteran sports journalist despite more than two decades of superlative work on the airwaves .
Parent company Bonneville condemned Napearâs innocent message as âparticularly insensitive , â kowtowing to BLM by expressing its ârespectâ for âthe black communityâ and âmarginalizedâ people .
( Never mind all the black small business owners and police officers targeted by Floyd-worshiping looters and shooters , or the white citizens marginalized for demanding law and order . )
In his lawsuit filed last week with the Eastern District of California court , Napear t ] he inherent worth and dignity of every personâ and âthe right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large.â Off with his head !
Napear recounted how KHTK barred him âfrom the Company premises as if I were a criminalâ despite a spotless and exemplary employment record .
His complaint laid out how Bonneville fired him âfor causeâ without any justification or explanation of how his tweet in defense of the sanctity of all life constituted âmisconduct.â Napear unflinchingly called out the him âbecause he is a Caucasian male who published a phrase on social mediaâ that went against Bonnevilleâs unstated policy supporting BLM .
Asked for any response to the suit , a Bonneville spokeswoman informed me this week : âWe have no comment.â As for Napear , he told me Monday : âMy message is simple .
What happened to me was a travesty .
I ’ m trying to right a wrong .
My hope is a victory will send a message to those who think canceling people for their beliefs won in the breach because âtoo many people are scared to speak up for what they believe in and what is right .
I ’ ve had numerous private conversations with some of the biggest names in our industry .
They ’ ve told me they are nervous about saying something on the air that will be misconstrued , or misinterpreted.â Napear has also talked to sports team owners who believe â [ i ] t is easier to go woke then deal with criticism.â But instead of going gently into the good night career , â Napear is holding the feckless smear merchants accountable .
âI want to be vindicated .
I want Bonneville International to apologize to me .
I want them to admit they panicked and made a mistake , â he told me .
âI am energized and ready to fight this battle not just for me , but for all of those who have been victims of this sick cancel culture.â In what remains of the land of the free and the home of the brave , Grant Napearâs life and livelihood to destroy him must be held to account .
Every single one .
