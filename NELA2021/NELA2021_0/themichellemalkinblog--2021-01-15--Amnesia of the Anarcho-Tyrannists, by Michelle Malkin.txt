Is it just me or has the entire universe of establishment media , politics and Hollywood forgotten that this country has endured an entire year of relentless violent anarchotyranny ?
Antifa and Black Lives Matter rioters set businesses and churches ablaze , smashed state capitols and laid siege to federal courthouses .
They permanently destroyed precious statues and symbols of America ’ s heritage .
They assaulted elderly people , stalked and menaced bystanders , taunted and terrorized law enforcement .
And they committed murder â dozens of times â in the name of social justice while the powers that they have all forgotten the grief of Ann Dorn , widow of retired St. Louis police captain David Dorn , who was slain by George Floyd vigilantes looting a pawn shop he was guarding on June 2 , 2020 .
Ann Dorn condemned the violence during a speech to the Republican National Convention last summer and recounted how she relives “ that horror in my mind every single day .
My hope is that having you relive it with me now will help shake this country from this nightmare we ’ re witnessing about positive , peaceful change.
” Dorn ’ s plea went unheeded .
Why ?
Because riots and invasive protest are the primary means by which the left operates and has always operated .
When they take over government buildings , like 40,000 Democratic union workers did when they stormed Wisconsin ’ s state capitol in 2011 for nearly a month , it ’ s not an insurrection .
It ’ s a First Amendment celebration .
When they take over U.S.
Senators ’ offices , like they did during the 2018 Kavanaugh sedition .
It ’ s “ democracy.
” When they feel like blocking traffic and shutting down highways , the police don ’ t arrest them .
They protect them .
And when they occupy U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities and vandalize federal courthouses â while obstructing homeland security operations , shining lasers in cops ’ eyes to blind them and hurling bricks at them to maim them â it ’ s not a crime .
It ’ s “ peaceful protest.
” This is not “ whataboutism.
” It ’ s we seek to make sense of what happened last week in our nation ’ s Capitol .
( And isn ’ t it the Left that always urges us to identify “ root causes ” when their thugs cross the line ? )
Law-abiding Americans are angry and frustrated precisely because the law has not been equally applied .
Whether we ’ re talking about lockdown rules or mob rules or election rules , the elites and their allies live by one set of rules and govern by another .
Hundreds of thousands smeared by pundits and politicians who have downplayed left-wing lawlessness from Day One of the Trump presidency .
Those who protest this injustice are being purged from social media and the public square at warp speed : âSome 70,000 dissidents on Twitter were summarily purged after being tarred as dangerous conspiracy theorists on Monday .
âAir Force veteran Ashli Babbitt , an unarmed Trump supporter who was gunned down by Capitol police last week , has been ruthlessly defamed by blue-checkmarked celebrities on Twitter and labeled a domestic terrorist .
âMAGA moms and by federal jackboots for attending the Jan. 6 rally , while antifa and BLM advocates gloat .
â ” Stop the Steal ” organizer Ali Alexander and his colleagues have been wiped off Silicon Valley platforms , along with conservative social media company Parler , libertarian Ron Paul , “ War Room ” host Steve Bannon , “ America First ” host Nick Fuentes , “ Red Elephants ” host Vince James , cartoonist Ben Garrison , Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton , election fraud researcher Ron Watkins , Gen. Michael Flynn , .
âTrump faces yet another phony impeachment attack despite his explicit call for supporters to “ peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.
” Meanwhile , actual convicted domestic terrorists like Black Liberation Army assassin Assata Shakur , Weather Underground killers Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert , and May 19th Communist Organizer Susan Rosenberg ( a left-wing weapons supplier and insurrectionist pardoned by Bill Clinton and now a board member of the umbrella group overseeing Black Lives Matter ) are deified by the media , Hollywood and academia .
Maxine Waters has been line about riots being the “ language of the unheard ” ever since she danced on the ashes of the L.A. riots with Bloods and Crips .
Liberal magazine Slate declared just six months ago in defense of antifa and BLM anarchotyrannists that “ non-violence is an important tool for protest , but so is violence.
” There simply can not be peace and civil order in such a dysfunctional country of double standards and stifled dissent .
It is dishonest and harmful to our republic to pretend otherwise .
