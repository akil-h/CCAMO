May 27 ( UPI ) -- Brooklyn forward Jeff Green strained his plantar fascia and will be re-evaluated in 10 days , meaning he will miss the remainder of the Nets ' first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics .
Nets head coach Steve Nash told reporters Thursday that Green will continue to travel with the team while working on his rehabilitation .
`` He has been so valuable to us this year with all the injuries we 've had , '' Nash said .
`` He 's been able to play multiple positions , different roles and fill in , we 're relatively healthy elsewhere .
But it is a loss . ''
Green , who has been a key rotational player for the Nets this season , exited Brooklyn 's Game 2 win over the Celtics on Tuesday with what the team called a bruised left foot .
Further evaluations revealed the strain .
The 34-year-old Green has started in 38 games and averaged 11 points , 3.9 rebounds and 1.6 assists this season .
`` He is a guy that has done a lot for us and means a lot , '' Nash said .
`` And we just hope that he can recover fully and get back out there in these playoffs . ''
Celtics star Jayson Tatum also departed Game 2 after he was accidentally poked in the eye .
Boston head coach Brad Stevens said Tatum practiced Thursday and will be available for Game 3 .
The Nets hold a 2-0 lead over the Celtics in the best-of-seven series .
Game 3 is scheduled for Friday night at TD Garden in Boston .
