Self-proclaimed “ prophet ” Hank Kunneman hosted a “ Prophetic Pulse Conference Call ” Wednesday night , where he continued to insist that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election , mainly because he can not accept that “ all of God ’ s messengers , prophets , intercessors , [ and ] Christians were somehow wrong ” while “ the enemy ” and the “ fake news ” were right .
Kunneman is among the various self-proclaimed “ prophets ” who guaranteed that Trump would win the election and now refuse to accept that their prophecies were wrong even the White House for over two months .
“ President Trump won the election , ” Kunneman asserted .
“ So , for people to say , ‘ Well , people prophesied that he ’ d win , ’ he did win , and so we had a stolen election.
” “ President Trump is not going anywhere , ” Kunneman added .
“ If you don ’ t like President Trump , that ’ s your problem because he ’ s not done talking , and God ’ s not done with been a lot of signs in the month of March ” that the alleged voter fraud that supposedly stole the election from Trump will soon be exposed , Kunneman insisted that Christians must remain faithful that he and the other “ prophets ” were right when they declared that Trump would serve a second term .
“ I ’ m sensing very strongly by the signs that God has given … that we are close to justice and righteousness being established , ” he said .
“ What we can not do is finger , and then begin to think , ‘ Well , you know what ?
All of this was just a smokescreen.
’ No , that ’ s what the enemy wants because it ’ s a sad day if all of God ’ s messengers , prophets , intercessors , [ and ] Christians were somehow wrong and the fake news that we know has been fake news were the voice of truth .
I don ’ t think so .
