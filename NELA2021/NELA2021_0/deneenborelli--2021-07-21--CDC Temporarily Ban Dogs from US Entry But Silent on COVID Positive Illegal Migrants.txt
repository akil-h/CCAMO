The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) issued a temporary ban on dogs entering the U.S. from foreign countries over rabies concerns from “ high-risk countries.
” Fox News host Tucker Carlson highlighted the temporary ban on dogs from foreign countries on his show with Jill Stewart , the founder and President of China Rescue Dogs .
Tom Borelli pointed out the twisted conflict in health priorities from the CDC .
On the one hand , the CDC is banning dogs over rabies concerns but the CDC remains silent on the COVID-19 risk from migrants that are ban is having a significant impact on U.S. military personnel and other overseas American families with dogs .
A petition is circulating to end the CDCs ’ ban against the import of dogs that is harming international rescue animals and American families .
While the CDC is cracking down on dogs from foreign countries from entering the U.S. , they are silent about the uptick in COVID-19 infected illegal migrants in detention centers .
New York Post reported the surge in infections earlier this month .
The CDC is missing the big picture ignoring the number of COVID-19 positive illegal migrants crossing the southern border is reckless and irresponsible by the CDC .
