Victoria “ Tori ” Rose Smith lived a tragically short life .
Three years .
That ’ s less than 200 weeks on this earth .
She was a girly girl who sported oversized bows in her straw-blonde hair and a megawatt smile on her face .
A great-aunt described the blue-eyed baby as “ bubbly , ” “ sassy ” and “ full of life ” despite bouncing around foster homes for much of her brief existence .
Last week , authorities in South Carolina revealed that Tori had perished as result of multiple blunt-force injuries to her tiny .
Her adoptive parents , Ariel and Jerry “ Austin ” Robinson , are now charged with homicide by child abuse .
A six-page police incident report describes how first responders rushed to the Robinsons ’ home on the afternoon of Jan. 14 , 2021 , after Mr. Robinson called 911 .
Little Tori was not breathing .
EMTs performed CPR .
She was rushed to the hospital , where she died .
Investigators immediately suspected child abuse .
The key to Tori ’ s murder lies in 17 redacted lines of the Carolina , police officer documenting his crime-scene interview with Ariel Robinson , who described an unknown incident involving her adopted daughter that had occurred the day before .
The entire paragraph is blacked out â an ominous chunk of hidden information about Tori ’ s last day on the planet .
Thanks to her ubiquitous social media presence , however , we can fill in a lot of blanks about Ariel Robinson .
She was a fame-chaser , an aspiring comedian , and a wannabe social media influencer who paraded her entire blended Tori and her two brothers , whom the Robinsons adopted all together ) on Twitter , Instagram and Facebook for clicks and likes .
Robinson had achieved minor notoriety as the Season 20 winner of the Food Network ’ s “ Worst Cooks in America ” contest .
She hosted a podcast with her husband and was set to launch a new YouTube this month called “ Cooking , Comedy , and Convos.
” Her YouTube channel has now been deleted .
But other dark clues remain .
In her past podcasts , thoughts .
“ I don ’ t feel like I want to hurt others , but some days I do want to hurt others , ” she rambled .
“ I don ’ t feel I would…I don ’ t feel homicidal , ” she told her audience , then seemed only to half-joke : “ Everybody want ( sic ) to hit somebody some days but I don ’ t want to kill nobody.
” She talked about the temptation to just “ snap ” and warned openly that “ ( i fly off the handle , punch somebody , kill somebody , assault , murder , you are one bad decision away from ruining the rest of your life.
” Perhaps most troubling , she used her apparent propensity for violence as material for her stand-up routines .
One video from 2019 shows her recounting how a social worker came to visit before she adopted Tori and her brothers .
Robinson ’ s own biological sons were making noise upstairs during the home interview , prompting Robinson to scream at the top of her I COME UP THERE AND PUNCH YOU IN YOUR THROAT.
” The audience laughed as she described how she downplayed the violent threat to the social worker ( “ Aw , ya know , it ’ s just a game ” ) and then delivered the punchline about the adoption to more peals of laughter : “ We got approved ” for Tori ’ s adoption â the audience erupted in cheers and giggles â “ we gon na have her by December.
” I ’ ve devoted this column space to beautiful t hear anything more about her in the “ mainstream ” media .
That ’ s because this homicide is wrapped up in a package of race and crime taboos you are not supposed to discuss .
Robinson is Black .
Tori was white .
On her social media accounts , Robinson promoted Black superiority , bashed Donald Trump and cops , and griped about institutional racism .
“ In my house , ” she wrote , “ my black children get treated the same as my white children , and my white black children .
It ’ s a shame that when they go out into the real world , that won ’ t be the case.
” Robinson punctuated the Jan. 6 , 2021 , Instagram post with the hashtags “ # whiteprivilege ” and “ # BlackLivesMatter.
” Eight days later , Robinson ’ s adopted white daughter succumbed to multiple blunt force trauma to her head and will never have a chance to “ go out into the real world.
” Did child welfare bureaucrats overlook Robinson ’ s mental health issues aware of her resentment of white people before they allowed her to adopt three white children ?
Did the system lower their standards to appease social justice and affirmative action crusaders ?
Were signs of abuse ignored out of deference to a rising celebrity whose politically correct status as a BLM-promoting do-gooder shielded her from scrutiny and criticism ?
Ideas have consequences .
So do lies .
Americans have been hopelessly conditioned to look the other way at cases like this , lest they commit what they ’ ve been taught is the ” Until it is thoroughly demolished by people of courage , the myth of white privilege will surely claim more victims .
Say her name : Victoria “ Tori ” Rose Smith ’ s life mattered .
