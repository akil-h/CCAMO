WASHINGTON ( AP ) — As the Supreme Court court weighs the future of the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision , a resurgent anti-abortion movement is looking to press its advantage in state-by-state battles while abortion-rights supporters prepare to play defense .
Both sides seem to be operating on the assumption that a court reshaped by former President Donald Trump will either overturn or seriously weaken Roe .
“ We have a storm to weather , ” said Elizabeth Nash , state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute , a research organization that supports abortion rights .
“ We in the future — five , 10 , 15 years from now — we 're talking about how we managed to repeal all these abortion bans.
” The institute estimates that as many as 26 states would institute some sort of abortion-access restrictions within a year , if permitted by the court .
At least 12 states have “ trigger bans ” on the books , with restrictions that would kick in automatically if the justices overturn or weaken federal protections on abortion access .
The current case before the court , Dobbs , concerns a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy .
Roe v. Wade , which was reaffirmed in a subsequent 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey , allows states to regulate but not ban abortion up until the point of fetal viability , at roughly 24 weeks .
The fate of the Mississippi case won ’ t be known for months , but based on opening arguments , Roe appears to be in peril .
All six of the court ’ s conservative justices , including Trump appointees Coney Barret , indicated they would uphold the Mississippi law .
“ There 's no doubt that what we heard from the Supreme Court was incredibly disturbing , ” said Ianthe Metzger , director of state media campaigns for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund , one of the most prominent advocates of abortion access rights .
“ It was n't really surprising but it was alarming.
” Susan Arnall , director of outreach for the anti-abortion Right to Life League , said she was particularly encouraged by Justice Samuel Alito 's emphasis on the fetus as a guiding principle on when to ban the termination of a pregnancy .
She predicts that modern advancements in medicine will continue to shrink the window in which a fetus is not viable , opening the door to a host of medically intricate state-level debates .
“ Viability is something that is subject to medical science , ” Arnall said .
“ It ’ s going to get intensely legal and intensely medical .
It ’ s going to be a battle of lawyers and doctors.
” Both sides seem for years , particularly with Trump having installed more than 200 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices during his presidency .
Pro-abortion-access groups donated $ 8 million in 2018 and more than $ 10 million in 2020 , according to Open Secrets , a nonpartisan group that tracks political spending .
Those numbers outpace the public contributions of anti-abortion groups , which donated $ 2.6 million in 2018 and $ 6.3 million in 2020 , according to Open Secrets .
But the complexity of the network of nonprofits and “ dark money a full accounting of the money flows .
While Washington is the primary current battleground , many leaders of the conservative movement are treating the judicial battle as won and Roe 's demise as an inevitability .
The next battleground will be a shifting cat-and-mouse fight in state legislatures and in next year 's elections across the country .
“ People are realizing that seven months from now , we ’ ll probably be dealing with this on a state level , ” said Brian Burch , president of CatholicVote .
“ This electoral races , especially governor ’ s races.
” Legislatures in many Republican-led states are poised for action depending on the Supreme Court ’ s ruling .
On Wednesday , the 6th U.S .
Circuit Court of Appeals vacated previous rulings that had blocked a Tennessee law that included banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected — about six weeks — and ordered a rehearing by the full court .
“ The battle has been happening in the statehouses for decades and it ’ s going to intensify , ” Nash said expected around June , almost guaranteeing that the issue will dominate next fall 's congressional elections as well as state-level races from coast to coast .
“ That 's perfect timing , just ahead of the midterms , '' said Arnall of the Right to Life League .
The ruling could set off a flurry of activity concerning medicinal abortions — a medical option that did n't exist when Roe became law .
`` Day after ” pills were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000 , with restrictions that included could be prescribed the two-pill regimen and a ban on sending them through the mail .
Those restrictions were relaxed during the coronavirus pandemic .
Women seeking the pills can now receive them in the mail after a long-distance consultation with a doctor and they do n't need to visit a clinic .
The FDA is scheduled to review that stance soon but either way , those policies are expected to come under immediate attack by Republican-held statehouses .
“ Medicinal abortions will be very high on the agenda.
” Nash said .
Texas , which has enacted a law effectively banning most surgical abortions after six weeks , has a new restriction that makes it a felony to provide the medical abortion pills after seven weeks of pregnancy and criminalizes sending the medication through the mail .
“ A coordinated disinformation campaign by anti-choice , anti-freedom politicians and activists has again allowed Texas to push care out of reach — particularly for those already marginalized by our health care system , ” NARAL Pro Choice President Mimi Timmaraju said in a statement .
`` There anti-choice extremists will push in their quest for power and control.
” Despite the historic setbacks , proponents of abortion access claim they are prepared for the state-by-state fight and are devising multiple ways to help women seeking abortions travel to states where they can receive them .
Metzger , of Planned Parenthood , predicted that the renewed threat will spark a massive wave of public support for abortion rights .
“ There 's no doubt that ( abortion opponents ) have been playing a 40-year game , ” Metzger said .
“ to sound the alarm .
People are seeing that the threat is very real .
This is not a theoretical argument anymore .
