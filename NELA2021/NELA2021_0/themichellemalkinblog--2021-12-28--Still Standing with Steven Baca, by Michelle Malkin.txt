Before Kyle Rittenhouse became a household name , there was Steven Baca .
You probably never knew or maybe have forgotten who Steven is .
I ’ d like to dedicate my last column of 2021 reminding you of his plight and asking you to help me support his defense of the right to self-defense .
Steven ’ s case matters because the woke , George Soros-funded district attorney leading the witch-hunt prosecution against Steven may soon be New Mexico ’ s next attorney general if good people do nothing .
Flashback to June 15 , 2020 : Across America It had been three weeks since the police-involved death of Minneapolis career criminal and drug addict George Floyd .
Black Lives Matter terrorists weaponized chaos nationwide to loot , pillage and burn down businesses small and large .
Antifa militants exploited every opportunity to target precious symbols of our national heritage and history , vandalize federal court buildings and churches , and menace all who stood in their way .
On June 15 , 2020 , as I reported on social media just hours after the violent events unfolded , Steven and several Tiguex Park in Albuquerque , New Mexico , to protect a statue of Spanish conquistador Juan de Onate .
Esther Rivera , a 14th-generation Albuquerque grandmother , showed up to guard the memorial and told me that night : “ I was there to pray for peace and the preservation of these statues and preservation of historical art.
” The Onate monument had long been a trigger for local agitators identified as Black Lives Matter protesters .
Onate , of course , had zilch to do with St. George Floyd or any alleged America .
But his legacy is part of the fabric woven by the settlers , pioneers , colonizers and founders who made America America .
And there ’ s nothing that the social justice crowd hates more than anything or anybody that represents our historic American nation .
Livestream video broadcast during the melee at Tiguex Park showed protesters wielding pickaxes and other objects .
They strapped chains to the Onate statue while several belligerent women verbally assaulted Rivera .
Some screamed falsely that she was a cop .
In several videos of at least two of the agitators can be seen laying hands on Rivera .
She told me one woman tried to steal her phone .
As she was pushed to the ground , Steven Baca tried to rescue her .
A swarm of women blocked Steven , and multiple videos show him trying to peel the women off of him and Rivera .
He was a defender , not an aggressor .
As I wrote in my syndicated column last year , assailants screamed falsely that Steven was a cop to stir up statue .
“ I ’ m gon na fâ-ing kill you , ” “ Get his license plate , ” and , “ Kill him , ” they threatened â all captured on video .
Steven retreated from the crowd , separated from Rivera .
He ran into the street , where several rioters beat him in the head and body with a large skateboard ( a “ longboard ” ) â eerily similar to what happened to Kyle Rittenhouse just two months later .
That is when Steven drew his weapon and The man who is captured assaulting Steven with the skateboard is Scott Williams , a left-wing rabble-rouser whose social media accounts promoted antifa , BLM , Saul Alinsky and extremist efforts to “ decolonize history.
” A police report on Williams I obtained documented his alleged harassment and threats against Albuquerque musician Alan Ledergerber for contributing to a GoFundMe campaign supporting free speech dissident Milo Yiannopoulos in 2017 .
Williams encouraged his friends to dox other donors .
The APD report detailed Williams ’ posts encouraging property damage and messages from Williams promising Ledergerber and destroy his career in the arts .
The Bernalillo County district attorney Raul Torrez brought no charges against Williams for assaulting Steven Baca .
Instead , he charged Steven with aggravated battery and unlawful carrying of a deadly weapon .
No trial date has been set , but pretrial hearings have been completed , and the case hangs heavy over Steven ’ s life .
I remind you that Raul Torrez is one of dozens of George Soros-subsidized subversives who put “ social justice ” above equal justice .
A Soros Safety & Justice ” PAC â pro-criminal , pro-rioter , anti-cop , anti-Second Amendment â dumped more than \ $ 107,000 into Torrez ’ s campaign in 2016 .
Torrez is now a leading contender to run for New Mexico attorney general in 2022 .
He is sitting on campaign coffers filled with \ $ 334,000 in cash .
Steven , meanwhile , continues to face threats to his safety .
After the Rittenhouse verdict , one agitator at a New Mexico protest told local media : “ It will not be justice We will not stand by if he walks free in New Mexico.
” I will not stand by and let Steven Baca be abandoned by so-called law-and-order conservatives and feckless Republicans who have ignored his plight and discouraged others from speaking out .
Steven is banned from Facebook and GoFundMe , but 1,275 donors have joined me in raising \ $ 60,000 for his case .
