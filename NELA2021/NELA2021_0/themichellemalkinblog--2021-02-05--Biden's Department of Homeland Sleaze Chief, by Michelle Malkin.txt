Everything old is new again .
The corruptocracy of the Obama administration is back with a vengeance in the White House .
Once more , the “ S ” in “ DHS ” stands not for security â but for sleaze .
Our nation is back for sale to the highest foreign bidders and their “ America last ” cronies .
Last Thursday , the Senate Homeland Security Committee pushed through the nomination of Alejandro “ Ali ” Mayorkas to head the U.S. Department of Homeland Security .
Six Senate Republicans sided with Democrats in breaking a GOP filibuster : Susan Collins of Maine , Rob Portman of Ohio , Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia , and Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska .
Just call them the Senate GOP Traitors ’ Caucus .
“ Inclement weather ” forced the postponement of the full and final Senate vote scheduled Monday , but the swamp always gets its way come rain , shine , sleet or snow .
Seven years ago , I first raised alarms when Barack Obama ’ s shady Chicago crony Mayorkas was tapped for the No .
2 surrendered then , as they will again now .
Mayorkas ’ main qualification for the deputy DHS secretary slot was his glorious record of achievement as a top Obama presidential campaign fundraiser in 2008 .
“ Obama bundler ” bestowed the same magical powers of access for Ali Mayorkas as “ Open , sesame !
” did for Ali Baba .
Mayorkas will fit right in under the rein of Quid Pro Joe .
As I reported during Mayorkas ’ 2013 confirmation hearings , Mayorkas phoned the Clinton White House while U.S. attorney Vignali .
Mayorkas joined other high-profile California liberals in the dialing-for-pardons campaign .
Vignali ’ s father ( also suspected of drug trafficking ) had dumped $ 200,000 in the coffers of Hillary Clinton ’ s brother , Hugh , to secure his son ’ s commutation .
Naturally , Mayorkas pleaded ignorance of Vignali senior ’ s suspected criminal activity and admitted failure to do his “ due diligence.
” Mayorkas ’ pardongate “ mistake ” cost him nothing .
Like so many slimy swamp creatures in Washington , he has repeatedly .
As the former head of Obama/Biden ’ s U.S .
Citizenship and Immigration Services agency , allegations of fraud , reckless rubber-stamping and lax enforcement â from veteran internal whistleblowers âplagued Mayorkas ’ tenure .
Senate Republicans went along with his appointment to the DHS No .
2 slot even though he had been under investigation for his role as a meddling fixer in foreign EB-5 visas-for-sale schemes for 15 months before that nomination .
Federal investigators interviewed more than 15 whistleblowers ranging from rank-and-file employees to several senior managers in California Mayorkas of bestowing preferential access and treatment to politically connected EB-5 applicants and stakeholders .
They detailed how Mayorkas “ created special processes and revised existing policies in the EB-5 program to accommodate specific parties ” while serving as director of the U.S .
Citizenship and Immigration Services .
“ Their allegations were unequivocal , ” the DHS inspector general concluded , and the corruption under Mayorkas was systemic .
Reminder : then-Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid pressured Mayorkas to overturn his agency ’ s rejection of expedited EB-5 visa applications for hotel , which just happened to be represented by Reid ’ s lawyer son Rory .
Adjudicators balked at the preferential treatment .
Mayorkas steamrolled the dissenters , who reported on shouting matches over the cases .
Reid ’ s staffers received special briefings from Mayorkas to update them on the project ’ s progress .
One underling called it “ a whole new phase of yuck.
” Meanwhile , in the words of one DHS official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement bureau , Mayorkas “ absolutely gave special treatment ” to sought EB-5 visas for another group of deep-pocketed Chinese investors .
Former Democratic National Committee chair and Virginia Gov .
Terry McAuliffe helmed the company after it was spun off from a Chinese venture .
Hillary Clinton ’ s late brother , Tony Rodham , spearheaded the EB-5 partnership with GreenTech .
Louisiana GOP Gov .
Bobby Jindal and former Mississippi GOP Gov .
Haley Barbour both lobbied for approval of the project .
McAuliffe whined to then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano when the department ’ s adjudicators rejected the GreenTech deal .
In Mayorkas met with McAuliffe in February 2011 and then met personally with senior staff to urge the agency to reverse its denials .
It did .
In 2018 , GreenTech filed for bankruptcy after raking in some $ 141 million from 283 EB-5 investors â mostly from China .
Nobody knows where all that money went .
More than 25 questions asked by GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley about Mayorkas ’ EB-5 interventions remain unanswered five years after the inspector general report lambasted his ethical breaches as “ corrosive and destabilizing.
” Perhaps Joe as the next DHS inspector general to guard the DHS sleazehouse â with the Senate GOP Traitor Caucus standing by to facilitate the uniparty ’ s sellout of America .
Where ’ s a Patriot Party when you need one ?
