President Biden flip-flopped on the decision to allow an investigation into the origin of the coronavirus .
News came out earlier this week that the State Department ’ s investigation of the origin of the coronavirus , initiated under former President Trump , ended due to “ concerns about the quality of its work.
” After considerable backlash , Biden issued a statement calling for a continued investigation over the next 90 days .
When asked during a press briefing about the resumed investigation , White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said there won ’ t be any comments investigation is complete .
Questions about where the coronavirus originated are heightened now that evidence is pointing towards a lab leak in China .
There is far more media coverage on the possibility the virus leaked from the lab and a Wall Street Journal exclusive cited sick staff members in the Wuhan lab prior to the pandemic .
And Dr. Anthony Fauci is also taking heat on his recent flip-flop over the origins of the coronavirus .
Fauci , the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National belief the virus did not escape from a Chinese lab but occurred naturally .
Now , Fauci is saying he was “ not convinced about that.
” The announcement of a 90-day investigation conveniently keeps Biden and his administration from commenting about where the virus originated .
Given the horrific toll the pandemic inflicted upon the world and the country , Americans must demand answers about the origin of the coronavirus and keep President Biden on the hook for answers .
