PALM BEACH ( The Borowitz Report ) —Donald J. Trump filed a hundred-million-dollar lawsuit after finishing a New York Times story that he started reading in 2018 , the former President has confirmed .
“ When I started reading the story three years ago , I saw my name in the headline and it made me happy , ” Trump told reporters .
“ It said ‘ Trump.
’ I thought , This is probably going to be a good story.
” As he continued reading the story in 2019 , he said , “ It still didn ’ t spent that year reading three or four paragraphs , and I didn ’ t really get the entire gist of the article.
” In 2020 , Trump said , “ I was busy with the election , so I didn ’ t get to read as much of the article as I would ’ ve liked .
I maybe got through five , six more sentences .
It mentioned my name a lot .
‘ Trump.
’ Still seemed O.K.
” Though Trump was ultimately able to finish the Times article this week it intentionally difficult for him to read .
“ Those so-called writers used many , many long words that I didn ’ t know—and Jared didn ’ t , either , ” he said .
“ We had to ask Ivanka what they meant , and , quite frankly , she had to look a lot of them up .
And those jokers won the Pulitzer for this crap ?
That should never be allowed to happen in this country .
