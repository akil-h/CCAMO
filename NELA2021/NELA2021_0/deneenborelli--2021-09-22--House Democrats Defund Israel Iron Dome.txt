The Iron Dome is the missile defense system Israel uses to protect its citizens from attacks from Hamas .
The measure was eliminated so the House could move forward with a temporary funding bill to keep the government operating .
Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) , Ilhan Omar ( D-MN ) and Rashida Tlaib ( D-MI ) backed the effort to deny funding of the Iron Dome .
Democrats were slammed on social media for caving to progressives in their military sales to Israel – a topic discussed on Newsmax ’ s National Report on Monday .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) allowed the anti-Israel measure to pass showing she will not oppose the most radical members of the House of Representatives .

The last thing the U.S. on another ally following the disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan .
