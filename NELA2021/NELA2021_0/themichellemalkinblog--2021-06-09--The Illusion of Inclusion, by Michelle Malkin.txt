I have been lately contemplating the utter disingenuousness of a certain genre of “ viral video.
” If you have had the unhealthy experience of spending any significant amount of time on social media , you ’ ll know exactly which one I mean .
It ’ s the category of manufactured feel-good clips I will heretofore refer to as the “ Different Drummer.
” The newest entry into the market of internet-manufactured sensations involves a charming 12-year-old boy named Trevor Bolling from the town of Dothan , Alabama .
Trevor ’ s sixth-grade teacher posted his spontaneous outbreak of ceremony on Facebook .
While the other cement-footed kids mouthed the words obligatorily to “ I ’ m Good ” by The Mowgli ’ s and cringed in the spotlight , Trevor sang it like he meant it .
He gesticulated .
He waved his hands here to there .
He waved ’ em like he just didn ’ t care .
And he belted out with unabashed feeling : “ I ’ m good ; I ’ m good ; I ’ m good ; I ’ m good / Livin ’ ’ t change it if I could / I ’ m good ; I ’ m good ; I ’ m good / Tryin ’ to figure out who I am / Or who I ’ m supposed to be / Feel good about where I stand / So I can make the most of me / … It ’ s been a long time livin ’ this way / Worrying what people say / Feelin ’ like I don ’ t fit in / But I won ’ t give up ; in / We ’ re looking for something more / What you ’ re really looking for / Has been with you since you were born.
” The Facebook video now has more than 4.1 million views , 82,000 likes and 16,000 comments in celebration of Trevor ’ s carefree performance .
His teacher pushed out the hashtag “ # BeLikeTrevor ” and praised the middle schooler ’ s independence .
All hail the Different Drummer , marching to his own beat : “ It didn ’ t matter if everyone else thought Trevor ’ s teacher told the local Dothan Eagle newspaper .
“ He simply wanted to be himself , and that ’ s what we want for our students , to be themselves .
They don ’ t have to be what they see on TikTok or other social media platforms.
” A parade of Different Drummers came before Trevor .
There ’ s 6-year-old Loren Patterson from Dickson County , Tennessee , who stomped her feet and let the spirit take over at First Baptist while singing with her Sunday school classmates Choir.
” Her video clip quickly racked up more than 40 million views in 2017 .
Then there ’ s 5-year-old Lily from Ohio whose grandma taped her breaking free from the rest of her robotic , mortified preschool peers while unleashing her best dance moves to kids ’ classic “ Tooty Ta.
” The clip topped 12 million views in 2019 .
Many others have enjoyed their dizzying 15 minutes of fame , appearances on the “ Today Show ” and “ The Tonight Show ” and countless tweets of encouragement from fearless swimming against the tide .
I want to think this phenomenon is real .
Truly , I want to believe .
But the ice-cold reality is that our schools , Silicon Valley , Hollywood and the corporate media are deceiving these young free spirits .
Fact check : The warm , treacly embrace of the dissident is all a big lie .
The pressure to conform in Black Lives Matter-genuflecting , COVID-19 hysteria-inducing , LGBTQXYZ flag-wrapped America will crush those who dare to “ break through ” and “ stand out.

You can ’ t stay in your sorority if you post a TikTok video saying , “ It ’ s OK to be white ” or , “ All lives matter.
” You can ’ t keep your job at Space Force if you criticize Marxism .
You can ’ t be part of a mainstream band and praise journalist Andy Ngo for exposing violent antifa extremists .
You can ’ t post on Facebook if you want to share your experience as a parent of a of poor Caleb Kennedy , a talented 16-year-old singer from Boiling Springs , South Carolina , who had advanced to the final four on “ American Idol.
” Like Trevor and Loren and Lily , Caleb was a born performer with a huge personality and a mullet to match .
His indie spirit and musical dreams were crushed last month , however , when an old Snapchat video of him from four years ago somehow “ surfaced.
” It showed him , age 12 , sitting next to a friend dressed in a horror movie they had just watched called “ The Strangers : Prey at Night.
” Somehow , the producers of the show â amplified by an all-too-eager social media mob that sees “ white supremacy ” in every cloud , white pillowcase and OK sign â characterized Caleb ’ s preteen friend as a “ racist , KKK ” promoter and convicted poor Caleb of guilt by association .
The illusion of inclusion dissolves like a mirage under scathing false accusations of racism â or any other departure from social justice orthodoxy .

America 2021 is not good .
Not good at all .
