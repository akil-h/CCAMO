WASHINGTON ( The Borowitz Report ) —In a new health advisory , the nation ’ s leading epidemiologist , Dr. Anthony Fauci , said that it is “ perfectly safe ” for Americans to watch YouTube , following news that Senator Rand Paul had been suspended from the platform .
“ In the past , I ’ ve warned about the health consequences of listening to Rand Paul , ” he said .
“ People experience headaches and nausea .
Sometimes , they feel like their brain cells are actually leaking straight out of their heads .
That ’ s to limit their exposure to this guy.
” Fauci said that , given Paul ’ s suspension from the site , previous health advisories regarding YouTube “ no longer apply.
” “ I think that this would be an excellent time for every American to enjoy YouTube , ” he said .
“ Watch some funny cat videos , or maybe some kooky skateboard stunts that went awry .
Rand Paul ’ s suspended for only seven days , so watch as much YouTube as you can while it ’ s still safe @
