What a sick joke .
Congresswoman Maxine Waters , one of the loudest mouths leading the impeachment circus against former President Donald Trump over the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6 , is a brazen racial insurrectionist .
The sixteen-term Democrat from South Central Los Angeles has been pouring verbal gasoline and tossing rhetorical Molotov cocktails into the public square since the 1992 L.A. riots .
Now she ’ s the arbiter of civility and keeper of social order ?
LOL .
Waters blasted Trump for telling his supporters on Jan. 6 to “ be tough ” and “ , peaceful stump speech fare .
She blames our 45th president for the actions of a few who ignored his explicit call to remain “ peaceful , ” while denying that her own fighting words and direct embrace of riots have contributed to decades of violent incitement .
Trump ’ s impeachment trial lawyers rightly allude to her instigation of mobs formed against administration officials at restaurants and public spaces .
In their trial brief , Trump ’ s team contrasted the president ’ s anodyne encouragement for conservative activists to “ fight Waters ’ endorsement of physical harassment against Trump ’ s cabinet members : “ If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant , in a department store , at a gasoline station , you get out and you create a crowd , ” Waters shrieked in 2018 at a rally in Los Angeles .
“ And you push back on them .
And you tell them they ’ re not welcome anymore , anywhere.
” That ’ s exactly what left-wing professional agitators , from Occupy ICE to antifa to Black the Sunrise Movement , have done over the past two years , targeting prominent Republicans and conservatives and their families on the streets and in their own homes .
But the fact is that Trump lawyers only scratched the surface of Waters ’ divisive and destabilizing diatribes .
I first began covering “ Turbulent Waters ” in the early 1990s as an editorial writer and columnist at the Los Angeles Daily News .
Let me remind you that newfound anti-insurrectionist Waters is the very same bloodthirsty opportunist who whitewashed the deadly L.A. riots the week-long shooting , looting and arson orgy as “ a spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice and a lot of alienation and frustration , ” and coddled Crips and Bloods gang members â with whom she performed the Electric Slide as part of her “ fearless support and understanding of young people and their efforts at self-expression.
” Waters made common cause with her neighborhood gangsta rappers who stoked the violence , calling them “ poets ” and “ children ” expressing their “ pain.
” I remind you that shortly Ice Cube ( a denizen of Waters ’ district and a member of the cop-killing glorifiers at rap group N.W.A . )
had penned the hate-filled song “ Black Korea ” for his best-selling platinum solo album , “ Death Certificate.
” He seethed against law-abiding immigrant entrepreneurs in his ‘ hood and threatened to burn their stores “ right down to a crisp ” : They hope I don ’ t pull out a Gat , try to rob Their funky little store , but , b-tch , I got a job up and down your market Or your little chop suey ass will be a target Juice with the people , that ’ s what the boy got… Or we ’ ll burn your store right down to a crisp .
Waters told the L.A. Times in May 1992 that “ riot is the voice of the unheard.
” She openly embraced the term “ insurrection ” as a substitute for “ riot ” in a 1992 interview with Katie Couric .
A quarter-century later , in an anniversary interview with the Huffington Post insurrection ” to celebrate the implosion of L.A. and stoking of anti-white , anti-Asian violence as a “ defining moment in the way that black people resisted.
” “ Resistance ” ?
Sixty people were killed , 2,000 injured , $ 1 billion in damages inflicted , and $ 700 million in federal aid injected to quell the arsonists , looters and shooters simply expressing their “ pain.
” “ Roiling Waters ” excused the violence repeatedly by defending the “ righteous anger ” of the rioters against police , innocent white bystanders to death by Waters ’ gangsta buddy Damian Williams ) , and the Korean shop owners ( forced to take up arms and take to their rooftops to defend their lives and livelihoods when the cops yielded to the mob ) .
Now , nearly 30 years later , the wealthy and powerful black congresswoman whose rise to power is defined by violence-inducing and violence-excusing racial demagoguery , demands “ accountability ” for words to remove a president no longer in office .
