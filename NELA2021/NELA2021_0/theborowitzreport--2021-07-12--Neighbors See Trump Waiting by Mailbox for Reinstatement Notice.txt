PALM BEACH ( The Borowitz Report ) —Neighbors of Donald J. Trump said that they have seen him check the mailbox in front of his house “ multiple times a day ” while waiting for what he called his “ reinstatement notice ” to come .
Mel and Tracy Klugian , who have lived next door to Mar-a-Lago for the past twenty-seven years , said that Trump starts checking the mailbox first thing in the morning , sometimes dressed in his bathrobe and slippers .
“ I told him that the mail doesn ’ t come until three most days I don ’ t mind waiting , ’ ” Mr. Klugian said .
According to Mrs. Klugian , Trump told her that his reinstatement notice could be coming “ any day now , ” and he doesn ’ t want to miss it .
“ When the mail truck comes , he gets this excited look on his face , ” she said .
“ Then he usually winds up with a bunch of Pottery Barn catalogues and whatnot , and he just trudges sadly back to the house.
” Mr. Klugian said remembered “ checking the mail a lot when I first retired.
” “ If you don ’ t have anything to do , the mail becomes kind of the high point of your day , ” he said .
“ He has to get into gardening or volunteering .
Something .
He can ’ t go on like this .
