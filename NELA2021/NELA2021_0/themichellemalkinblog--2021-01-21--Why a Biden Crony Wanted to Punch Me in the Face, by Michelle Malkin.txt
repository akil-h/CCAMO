When you ’ re catching flak , you ’ re over the target .
When you ’ re triggering threats of violence from the Biden crime family , you know you ’ ve hit the bull ’ s-eye .
As the entrenched Obama-Biden syndicate that I chronicled in my 2009 book , “ Culture of Corruption , ” officially returns to power in Washington , D.C. , this week , it ’ s worth calling attention to a telling little message from Hunter Biden ’ s top business partner about yours truly .
The Feb. 15 , 2011 email was laptop of Joe Biden ’ s scandal-plagued son .
Heres ’ the backdrop : Over the past decade , I have reported extensively on Joe Biden ’ s lifelong milking of his entrenched swamp career for the benefit of his family â including his promotion of government-subsidized Amtrak rail boondoggles .
During his tenure as vice president in the Obama administration , Biden fronted a $ 53 billion high-speed train initiative .
He installed friends and family inside the agency while eliminating longtime fiscal watchdogs looking out for taxpayers .
In 2009 , Fred Weiderhold was abruptly “ retired ” â just as the government-subsidized rail service faced mounting complaints about its meddling in financial audits and probes .
Weiderhold had blown the whistle on overzealous intrusion by the agency ’ s Law Department into his investigations of $ 1.3 billion in rail stimulus money and exposed how Amtrak ’ s legal counsel had usurped the watchdog ’ s $ 5 million portion of federal stimulus dollars to hamstring his probes .
Weiderhold discovered that the federal rail bureaucracy was retaining outside law firms beyond the subpoenas issued to an outside financial adviser .
A 2010 report by GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley and Rep. Darrell Issa concluded that the Amtrak board improperly removed the agency inspector general without required prior notice to Congress .
Who ousted Weiderhold ?
Still can ’ t say for sure , but I noted at the time that Biden ’ s lobbyist son , Hunter , was sitting on the Amtrak board of directors when Weiderhold was pushed out .
Hunter raked in tens of thousands of dollars for showing up to Amtrak meetings of Joe , was Amtrak ’ s vice president and general counsel .
She oversaw the very Law Department accused of interfering repeatedly with the taxpayer advocates in the inspector general ’ s office .
Acheson had also hired Biden ’ s former Senate staffer Jonathan Meyer as her deputy general counsel .
Meyer called it a “ happy coincidence.
” Hunter ’ s business partner , Eric Schwerin , wasn ’ t happy about my reporting on these matters in my syndicated columns and on my blog .
In 2011 , Schwerin company , Rosemont Seneca .
He wrote to Hunter with the subject headline , “ M .
Malkin , ” on Feb. 15 , 2011 , at 9:37 p.m. : “ Just read the blog post .
Does anyone push back against her directly when she says you are a ‘ lobbyist ’ and are currently on the Amtrak board ?
I am sure it would be far worse to antagonize her , but it drives me crazy .
I want to punch her in the face.
” Quid Pro Joe and his they have profited mightily from their nepotistic enterprises .
But who knew it inspired such fantasies of misogynistic violence ?
If Schwerin ’ s name sounds vaguely familiar , then you ’ ve been paying attention : âIt ’ s Schwerin who informed Hunter in other emails that he had failed to disclose $ 400,000 in payments he received from Ukrainian energy company Burisma in 2014 after taking in $ 1.2 million that year .
âIt ’ s Schwerin who was enmeshed in communications between Rosemont Seneca and a Chinese Communist Party-owned business Studios theme park outside of Beijing .
âIt ’ s Schwerin who told Hunter in 2018 that a Chinese private equity firm , BHR Partners , would generate income for him “ over the next couple of years.
” âIt ’ s Schwerin who was rewarded by President Obama with a presidential commission appointment in 2015 .
Hunter ’ s laptop contains a trove of emails between Hunter , Schwerin and various other business associates who secured Amtrak contracts to produce railroad cars and build tunnels .
Internet investigator and blogger Nick Monroe and insider information solicitations involving Hunter , Schwerin , Rosemont Seneca , CAF Railway Solutions and infrastructure design firm HNTB Corporation .
In 2010 , for example , Schwerin informed Rosemont colleagues that a CAF/Amtrak deal had gone through and started counting the big bucks : “ I think we should ask for $ 75,000 upfront ( which is 30 % ) .
Then begin billing them on a monthly basis sixty days later for the remaining $ 175,000 ( so for the remaining 10 months it would be $ 17,500 a month messaged Hunter privately : “ For CAF we are guaranteed $ 180,000 ( or $ 15,000 a month ) for a year.
” Sifting through a raft of similar messages , Monroe concluded : “ It ’ s through that we can see that Hunter Biden made a six-figure sum from leveraging his existing relationship with Amtrak , if not more .
The door is open for authorities to audit Amtrak and investigate the full extent of taxpayer dollars that Hunter pilfered through his work.
” Don ’ t get your hopes up and the operatives of the “ deep state ” will be too busy the next four years kissing the Biden corruptocrats ’ backsides â and protecting their privileged noses from harm .
