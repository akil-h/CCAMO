Vice President Kamala Harris ’ s book for children is being given to migrant children held in a California detention center .
Harris ’ s 2019 book Superheroes Are Everywhere was given to migrant children as part of their welcome packets at the Long Beach Convention & Entertainment Center .
According to Fox News , it ’ s not known who bought the books .
Critics pointed out Harris ’ s book made it to a detention center but the vice president has yet to visit the southern border .
When asked about critics calling out her avoiding the border ” About a month ago , President Biden assigned Harris the job of dealing with the border crisis .
Colorado Republican Representative Ken Buck claimed Harris was making money on the border crisis – an issue she fails to recognize and address .
It ’ s clear Harris is trying to avoid making an appearance at the southern border since given the responsibility from Biden .
I agree with my husband Tom ’ s assessment of the decision by Harris not to travel to see first hand what ’ s happening at detention afraid of a bad photo opportunity that will personally tie her to the crisis .
According to Rasmussen Reports , Harris already has low approval ratings with “ 51 % of Likely U.S .
Voters have an unfavorable impression of Harris , including 43 % who have a Very Unfavorable impression of Joe Biden ’ s vice president .
