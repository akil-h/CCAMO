I sent a simple request in April to my government for public data that taxpayers have the right to see .
Through the federal Freedom of Information Act , I asked the Transportation Security Administration ( as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation ) for the following information : No .
1 : The policy statement outlining the processes and criteria according to which officials nominate , consider and approve names for the no-fly list , selectee list and extended selectee list .
No .
2 : All information , documents , records and communications within the TSA and/or attendees of the Jan. 6 , 2021 , Capitol rally and their inclusion on the no-fly list , selectee list and extended selectee list from Jan. 6 , 2021 , through the present .
( I requested copies of all information , records , emails , phone logs/transcripts , letters , notes , memoranda and all electronic or nonelectronic communications/records/information related to aforementioned events and aforementioned parties . )
No .
3 : All information , documents , records and communications within the TSA and/or between the TSA and the FBI using the “ Nicholas Fuentes , ” “ Nicholas J. Fuentes , ” “ America First , ” “ Lauren Witzke , ” “ AFPAC ” or “ Groypers.
” You ’ ll be interested to know , my fellow American citizens and taxpayers , that the price of unlocking the TSA/FBI ’ s no-fly secrets is precisely $ 4,536 ( $ 28/hour ) .
Michael Tobias , government information specialist at Department of Homeland Security/Transportation Security Administration/Freedom of Information Act Branch , informed me that “ it would take a combined search time of and that half of the estimated cost â $ 2,268 of the $ 4,536 â would be due up front as an advance payment .
“ Thank you and have a great day !
” Tobias ended his missive to me .
So much for “ freedom ” of information .
LOL .
I have appealed this onerous tax on investigative journalism and refiled my FOIA request this week , noting that I am a member of the media and reiterating that any information I receive will be shared with the public .
the meantime , ask yourselves ( and your elected representatives , while you ’ re at it ) this question : What is our government trying to hide at such a high cost to ordinary Americans ?
As I reported in this column in April , the subjects of my FOIA request ( Nick Fuentes and Lauren Witzke ) have faced repeated obstacles to traveling by air since the beginning of the year .
Their plight is part of what I believe is a clearly coordinated campaign of discrimination by Big Government and Remember : Multimedia entrepreneur Nick Fuentes has been banned by all the usual Big Tech suspects ( most recently by Twitter last week after the Anti-Defamation League published a hit piece ) , along with livestream service DLive , Coinbase and every payment processor for his forceful advocacy of populism , an end to mass migration and protection of the nuclear family .
Former Delaware GOP Senate candidate Lauren Witzke ( banned from Twitter for calling a pedophilia-flirting transgender activist “ demonic ” ) had her Wells Fargo account shut down just last U.S. Capitol rally for former President Donald Trump , but neither had entered the building .
Neither has been charged with any crimes .
Both were peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights .
Yet , President Joe Biden ’ s TSA and multiple airlines told Fuentes he no longer has “ clearance ” to fly ; Witzke can not check into flights online , is swabbed for explosives and has “ Secondary Security Screening Selection ” marked on her tickets .
My FOIA request would help unearth clues as to the criteria for on secret lists and tyrannically classifying them as “ security ” threats .
Witzke called out the feds ’ information lockdown for the bribery that it is : “ The full force of the federal government is trying to extort ordinary Americans who just want to know the truth .
WHY are they persecuting us ?
” Laura Loomer , another early and repeated victim of Big Government/Big Tech abuse , also weighed in : “ Not only are they trying to extort people for wanting to know the truth , but they lawyers requests to find out why the FBI has illegally red flagged me ” and prevented her unilaterally from owning firearms .
“ The federal government is illegally extorting Americans and they are abusing their power to politically persecute and target political opposition.
” The rest of the deep-pocketed corporate media remains stubbornly uninterested in freeing the truth on behalf of persecuted dissidents .
It ’ s not a newsflash , but it bears repeating : The Fourth Estate is not a neutral actor , but an active collaborator with the Swamp and @
