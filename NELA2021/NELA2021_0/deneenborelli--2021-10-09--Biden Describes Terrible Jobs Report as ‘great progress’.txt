Despite the disappointing result , Biden dismissed the September number saying , monthly results “ bounce around ” and he focused on the yearly job growth concluding , “ now that ’ s progress.
” President Joe Biden said the ” in getting the U.S. economy back on track after a year and a half of Covid-19 pandemic disruption , even as the overall jobs number came in lower than expected .
