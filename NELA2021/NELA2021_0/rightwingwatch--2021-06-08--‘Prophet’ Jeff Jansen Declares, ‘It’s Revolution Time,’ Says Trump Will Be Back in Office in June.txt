Jeff Jansen , a self-proclaimed “ prophet ” who was among those who guaranteed that former President Donald Trump would win reelection in 2020 , posted a video on his Facebook page Saturday in which he asserted once again that Trump will soon be put back in office .
Jansen , who led Global Fire Ministries International in Murfreesboro , Tennessee , until he was recently fired “ due to a pattern of making poor moral choices , and bad coping mechanisms , character flaws , ” and “ unscriptural and unbiblical behavior , ” declared earlier this year that law as the military prepared to remove President Joe Biden from office and reinstall Trump .
Jansen originally prophesied that this would happen by June , but in March he updated his prophecy to declare that it would actually happen by the end of April .
Despite the fact that April came and went with Biden still in the White House , Jansen continued to insist that his prophecy was accurate .
In a video urging people to watch the speech Trump was scheduled to deliver to the North Carolina Republican convention Saturday June deadline of his original prophecy , insisting that Biden will soon be removed and replaced by Trump .
“ President Trump is going to be addressing the GOP and the nation , ” Jansen said .
“ Watch what happens .
I said by spring , which starts officially June 23 , we ’ d be dancing in the streets .
The Trump administration is on its way in ; the pedophilia Biden administration—the fake administration—Biden ’ s administration is on its way out .
I don ’ t care if you ’ t matter .
We all know what took place , and God is going to do something amazing in this nation and through this nation .
It ’ s revival time .
It ’ s revolution time.
” For the record , spring does not start on June 23 , as Jansen claimed .
It actually began on March 20 , 2021 and ends on June 20 , 2021 .
