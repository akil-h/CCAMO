Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas acknowledged over 12,000 Haitian migrants were released into the U.S. Mayorkas admitted the number of Haitians could be higher during an interview on Fox News Sunday .
So far , approximately 12,400 of the people are having their cases heard by immigration judges , while another 5,000 are being processed by the Department of Homeland Security .
Currently , , only 3,000 are in detention .
In addition , Mayorkas acknowledged the Haitians released into the U.S. were not tested for COVID-19 and they were not vaccinated even though the population is known .
Despite the huge surge of illegal migrants , Mayorkas said the Biden administration remains opposed to the construction of a border wall .
While Mayorkas claimed the border was not open , a Daily Caller reporter provided video evidence Mayorkas ’ statement was inaccurate : The mass release of untested Haitian migrants conflicts with Mayorkas ’ s claim that illegal migrants are expelled because of public health reasons under Title 42 .
Releasing over 12,000 illegal Haitians into the U.S. makes a mockery of Mayorkas ’ claim the border is not open s actions to combat SARS-CoV-2 .
Inexplicably , Biden directed a vaccine mandate but allows untested and unvaccinated illegal migrants to roam the U.S. Uncontrolled migration is a major reason Biden ’ s approval rating is in free fall .
