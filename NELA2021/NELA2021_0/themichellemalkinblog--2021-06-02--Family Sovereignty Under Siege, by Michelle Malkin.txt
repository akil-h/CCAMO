Parents , beware .
The dominion you have over your own children is under attack like never before .
Teenage puppets for Big Pharma are being deployed on the ground and across social media airwaves to convince their peers to inject themselves with experimental drugs to allegedly prevent a disease for which the youth mortality rate is practically zero .
“ Do it for the herd ” is the new rallying cry of designated “ VaxTeen ambassadors ” spearheading COVID-19 jab pop-up clinics at schools and churches nationwide targeting 25 million American children ages 12 to 17 .
VaxTeen is lobby , and the Public Goods Project ( a mysterious public health nonprofit backed by Silicon Valley , ad agencies and drug companies ) .
As of last week , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , more than 2 million 12-15-year-olds and 2.5 million 16-17-year-olds had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose .
That ’ s about 12 % and 31 % of adolescents in each respective age group .
Increasing those rates has nothing to do with a cure and everything to do with control and conformity .
That is ” moms and dads â in other words , independent-thinking and responsible moms and dads â are viewed as obstacles and enemies to be overcome for the “ public good.
” The Kaiser Family Foundation crew has raised an alarm over the nearly 25 % of all parents in a recent survey who said they would not allow their teens to be vaccinated .
“ Parental consent , ” two NBC News reporters bemoaned , is a problem that children must “ contend with across the country ” â as if parental authority , not a God-given right to protect .
Last December , I warned in this column about the erosion of informed consent at the dawn of the most coercive era of medical tyranny in human history .
The once-sacred principles enshrined in the Nuremberg Code and the Helsinki Declaration â autonomy and self-determination over medical decisions , voluntary exercise of the free power of choice , full disclosure of all relevant information and competency of the individual â have vanished .
Since the Washington , D.C. , City Council ’ s adoption of without parental consent , several more jurisdictions have put family sovereignty in their crosshairs .
In Pennsylvania , a proposed state law would allow teens 14 and up to evade parental control and get the COVID-19 shot .
The Philadelphia Board of Health declared in a recent order that “ individuals 11 years of age and older ” can now “ consent to ( their ) own immunization with a COVID-19 vaccine under an Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) , without the approval or consent of a parent or guardian.
” In obtained to allow for vaccination if a parent does not consent .
In San Francisco , minors 12 and up have been granted the right to “ self-consent ” to COVID-19 shots without parental permission .
In addition , North Carolina teenagers can receive vaccinations ( not just COVID-19 ) without parental consent ; teenagers 14 and up in Tennessee and Alabama don ’ t need consent ; in Oregon , those 15 and older can evade parental consent laws ; in Iowa , health care providers have discretion over children and teens VaxTeen ambassadors are using TikTok , Instagram , Facebook and Twitter to lure students to their pop-up clinics , where free pretzels , ice cream and live music are in abundance .
In Santa Clara County , California , the vax bribery is over-the-top : gift cards to Starbucks or Chipotle and backstage football stadium passes in partnership with the San Francisco 49ers .
The COVID-19 tyrants are using kiddie human shields to crank up the propaganda to drive ever-greater wedges between children and their parents .
Unvaxxed kids are being told by parents are responsible for a “ dangerous tide of misinformation.
” But they won ’ t be told about Big Pharma ’ s immunity from vaccine lawsuits or that the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has paid out more than $ 4.3 billion to the vaccine-injured since 1988 or that the pioneer behind mRNA technology was censored by Twitter last week for daring to discuss the troubling phenomenon of “ vaccine shedding.
” The idea that easily influenced teenagers , let alone 11-year-old kids , could provide medical consent voluntarily and in a climate is a human rights abomination .
They are being bombarded by pro-COVID-19 vaccination Hollywood agitprop , conditioned by ubiquitous pro-COVID-19 vaccination content on social media , held hostage in public schools , deceived by Big Pharma ’ s omissions and suppression of data , and viciously turned against their parents by a coordinated peer pressure campaign to stigmatize all dissent , no matter how mild .
Make no mistake : This isn ’ t war on a pandemic .
This is war on the nuclear family .
