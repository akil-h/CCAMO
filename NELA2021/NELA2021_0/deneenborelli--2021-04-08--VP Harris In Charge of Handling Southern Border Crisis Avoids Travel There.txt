President Biden recently appointed Vice President Kamala Harris to oversee the U.S.-Mexico southern border crisis but going to the border isn ’ t a priority for her .
Biden announced a few weeks ago that Harris is in charge of handling the southern border crisis , saying , she “ agreed to lead our diplomatic effort and work with those nations to accept the returnees , and enhance migration enforcement at their borders — at their borders.
” However , Harris has yet to make the trip to the southern border .
Recently , Harris traveled to Connecticut to meet helping to relocate illegal migrant children .
Harris also traveled to California to meet with Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom to tour a water treatment facility and to Illinois to meet with Democrat Mayor Lori Lightfoot on COVID-19 vaccine distribution .
White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked when will the vice president visit the southern border and she responded , “ I don ’ t have any trips to outline or preview.
” When pressed further on Harris ’ recent travel , including visiting a Chicago bakery , Psaki doubled down and Brnovich sent a letter to Harris inviting her to tour the southwest border with him and highlighted how dangerous the situation is .
Last month , Harris responded with a laugh when asked when she planned to visit the southern border and critics commented on social media .
While the chaos at the U.S.-Mexico southern border rages on , Harris doesn ’ t seem to view the dire circumstances as a priority .
Whatever the reason , there is a total lack of leadership on this issue in the Biden administration .
