COLORADO SPRINGS â They admitted it .
Now , they think they can get away with it .
Three weeks ago , I reported to you on the appalling case of 6th-grade student Rylee M. , who was pressured by teachers at Chinook Trail Middle School to seal her mask to her face with thick blue paintersâ tape .
Another schoolmate came forward to describe how those teachers would patrol their classrooms for violators while twirling the tape rolls around their wrists .
Skeptics accused the children of manufacturing the story and of voluntarily putting the tape on themselves .
Department school resource officer stationed at Chinook Trail , baselessly dismissed the incident as a prank committed by a teacher in âjest.â Gaslighters in the school district and their supporters misleadingly denied that teachers applied the tape directly to victimsâ faces–something Rylee and her mom never alleged .
By mischaracterizing the actual allegations , public school propagandists deflected attention from the brazen abuse of authority exercised by educators who issued de facto ultimatums that children comply with their directive to use the tape handed to them .
Or else .
On Monday , Chinook Trail Middle School principal Tom Andrew confirmed in a meeting with Ryleeâs mom , Stephanie M. , that teachers had indeed directed students to affix a mask to their face with tapeââa cruel measure that only sadists , not sane public health advocates , could embrace .
Moreover , the unfazed principal blandly acknowledged , âyes , â the âstudents thought they were compelled to follow throughâ on the teachersâ ârequestsâ ( to choke themselves off ) .
âIn short , â the principal told Ryleeâs mom in his sing-song scripted voice , â âtrust and respectâ were âbroken , â and âpoor decisionsâ were made .
Now , the principal told Stephanie M. , itâs time âto move this forwardâ after âadmitting our mistakeâ and “ trust ” the administration .
The abusers will remain in the classroom with vulnerable 11- and 12-year-olds ; any disciplinary measures will be kept âconfidential ; â and brave Rylee , who has been harassed over the incident , will now be enrolled in online school to keep her safe from the mask bondage bullies .
âIt was group of âTeam 642â tape torturers wrote in a crappy little note to parents handed out Monday night at a meeting closed to the public , âto cause anxiety , fear , confusion , or physical or emotional harm.â Never mind that these petty tyrants wrought all of the above and will be shielded from any transparent punishment .
âWe look forward to returning to normal and continuing along this learning journey with your family , â the teachers ( none of whom have reached out to Rylee or her mom directly ) pretending to say youâre sorry without ever suffering consequences for wrongdoing .
Darcy Schoening , parent advocate and Town of Monument Board of Trustees member , agrees .
She believes “ the teachers responsible for this behavior should be fired .
Their names should be released .
Parents have the right to know WHO is abusing their kids .
Protecting the teachersâ identities and disciplinary actions is a slap in the face to parents.
” âItâs sickening to me , â Stephanie lamented , as the principal echoed the educratsâ desire to get âresume normalcy.â She ’ s not going to let it drop .
âI am not going to be quiet , â the work-at-home mom of three young daughters told KVOR-AM 740 radio talk show hostRichard Randall this week .
âPlenty of parents are ready to step up for their kids.â No doubt about it .
The Election Day revolt against K-12 control freaks just demonstrated that parents across the country from Loudon County , Va. , to El Paso County , Co. , to Los Angeles County , Calif. , will not let freedom .
With Justice Department goons and local cops treating parents protesting at school board meetings like criminals , we know we can ’ t rely on law enforcement to side with sovereignty-defenders over the State .
Remember : Stephanie M. immediately contacted the Colorado Springs Police Department to report the abuse as soon as her daughter told her what happened .
They blew her off .
Instead , according to creepy public records files I obtained last week , at least three members of the CSPDâs Metropolitan Narcotics , and Intelligence Division/Stratetic Gab posts about Ryleeâs case to several CSPD command staff and other individuals whose names were redacted .
A CSPD âIntelligence Unitâ detective made note of my â2 million ( yes , 2 million ) Twitter followersâ ( so what ? )
and a sergeant falsely claimed I was aware of protest plans at the school ( I heard no such information until after administrators shut down the school on Oct. 25 amid an international maelstrom of public scrutiny and press coverage–and no such protest ever occurred ) .
[ These are my district redacted when it released public records to a requestor . ]
It ’ s getting impossible to “ back the blue ” when they stand down as Antifa and Black Lives Matter attack you for defending law and order , kneel before the altar of George Floyd , enforce junk-science-based COVID tyranny lining the pockets of Big Pharma and Big Government , and spy on you for standing up for parents fighting educational malpractice .
Teach your children well .
