WASHINGTON ( The Borowitz Report ) —A furious Josh Hawley announced on Monday that he would attempt to overturn the results of last weekend ’ s CPAC straw poll , which showed him to be the choice of only three per cent of attendees .
Claiming that there was “ widespread fraud ” in the way that the straw poll was conducted , he demanded urgent action to “ stop the steal.
” “ If CPAC does not immediately halt the certification of its straw-poll results , people will lose faith in CPAC as one of our nation ’ s said .
Asked to provide evidence of straw-poll fraud , Hawley said , “ There was a really cool photo of me pumping my fist in the air that everybody saw .
That should be worth way more than three per cent.
” Responding to the senator ’ s demands , CPAC conducted a thorough recount of its straw poll , and found that Hawley had actually received two per cent .
