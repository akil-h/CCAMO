In September 2020 , right here in this nationally syndicated newspaper column and on a subsequent report on my Newsmax show , “ Sovereign Nation , ” I sounded the alarm over Silicon Valley ’ s hijacking of our election system through a private nonprofit called the Center for Technology and Civic Life .
In October , I tipped off the White House and publicly urged the FBI and Justice Department to investigate .
Nothing was done .
Not a single federal official objected .
So , the Zuckerberg Heist will happen again and again in this farce of a in America are a pipe dream .
In case you were snoozing , as far too many citizens in this country are , CTCL is the deep-pocketed liberal advocacy group subsidized by Big Tech oligarchs and radical philanthropists .
The center received $ 350 million from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife , Priscilla Chan .
Election information-rigging Google is a top corporate partner .
The Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Democracy Fund ( founded by “ Never Trumper ” billionaire and eBay former chairman Pierre Omidyar ) also pitched in .
the 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) “ charity , ” but I can ’ t tell you who and how many they are because their identities are protected by IRS rules .
I was able to tell you last fall how CTCL solicited over 1,100 applications from across the country for the group ’ s purported “ COVID-19 Response Grant Program ” to “ provide funding to U.S. local election offices ” that steered voters toward alternatives to traditional voting .
The pandemic provided a handy ruse to sabotage our regular more manipulable absentee and vote-by-mail mechanisms .
I showed you how there is nothing “ nonpartisan ” about CTCL ’ s enterprise .
The Center ’ s top staff ( many of them Barack Obama campaign tech gurus ) come from a now-defunct liberal nonprofit called the New Organizing Institute , whose far-left donors include George Soros ’ s Open Society Foundation , the Ford Foundation and Atlantic Philanthropies .
CTCL director Tiana Epps-Johnson is a former Obama Foundation fellow .
Former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe , author of “ The Citizens worked for Zuckerberg ’ s foundation .
Chicago political activist Jay Stone , The Amistad Project of the Thomas More Society , and watchdogs in Michigan , Wisconsin and Pennsylvania all filed lawsuits prior to Election Day against CTCL ’ s partisan grant scheme to affect battleground states ’ and counties ’ election results .
This week , just as I prepared to file this column , The Amistad Project filed a new suit against Fulton County , Georgia ( home of the pipe burst shenanigans that shut down absentee ballot counting on CTCL funds in both the general election and the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections .
“ The sanctity of our electoral process is being violated by the unprecedented infusion of private money , ” Phill Kline , director of the Amistad Project , warned .
“ Instead of being distributed equally , as the law requires , ” he noted , “ election funding is now being doled out by private interests seeking to influence the process for partisan advantage.
” According to The Amistad Project , the money that Fulton County has to the amount the county received from public sources for the 2020 general election.
” Grant recipients must abide by Zuckerberg/CTCL ’ s requirements on how many polling places and absentee ballot drop boxes it supplies .
Election judges have been subsidized with Big Tech/Democrat operatives ’ money .
The grants have reportedly been used to facilitate illegal “ curing ” of flawed ballots while GOP observers were blocked from doing their jobs .
â What conversations has Mark Zuckerberg and/or those on his staff had with David Plouffe and/or Plouffe ’ s discussed ?
Will Zuckerberg share related emails ?
â What strategic discussions has Zuckerberg had with CTCL ’ s leadership ?
How does he monitor CTCL ’ s progress ?
Will he share emails pertaining to these matters ?
The Democrats like to say that “ your voice is your vote.
” When tech oligarch Mark Zuckerberg ( net worth : $ 100 billion ) has the unregulated and unmitigated ability to dictate how America ’ s elections are run , who runs them , how we cast our ballots , and who have left ?
