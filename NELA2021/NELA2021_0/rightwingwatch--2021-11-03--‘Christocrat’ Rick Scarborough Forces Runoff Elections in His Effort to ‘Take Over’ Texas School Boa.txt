In September , Right Wing Watch reported that Rick Scarborough , a self-described “ Christocrat , ” strident anti-LGBTQ activist , and longtime critic of public education , had begun raising money through his group Recover America to fund an effort to elect right-wing candidates to school boards in three Houston-area school districts .
In October , Scarborough announced that if his group was successful in taking over these three school boards , he planned to raise millions of dollars to mobilize thousands of Texas pastors who will activate their congregations to ensure that conservative Christians “ take over their .
In Tuesday ’ s election , five of the nine trustees on the Houston Independent School District board of education were up for reelection , and they were all targets of Scarborough ’ s effort .
While Scarborough did not succeed in defeating any of them , four of them have been forced into runoff elections in December , which is required if no candidate secures more than 50 percent of the vote .
School board incumbents Elizabeth Santos , Sue Deigaard , Holly Flynn Vilaseca , Anne Sung , and Myrna was the only one to clear the 50 percent requirement to secure reelection after Tuesday ’ s voting .
While Santos , Deigaard , and Vilaseca all received the most votes in their respective races , none received enough votes to win outright , whereas Sung finished second to a challenger who did not secure 50 percent of the vote , meaning that all four will be headed into runoff elections in December .
