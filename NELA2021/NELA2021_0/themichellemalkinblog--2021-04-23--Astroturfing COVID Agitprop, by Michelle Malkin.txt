Attention , parents : If your children are online , they are being bombarded by an inescapable public relations campaign by all the Bigs â Big Pharma , Big Government and Big Tech â to brainwash them about the COVID vaccine .
While children under 18 remain at the lowest risk of COVID-19 , peer pressure to get the experimental jabs is enormous .
That groupthink is compounded by relentless messaging from politicians , celebrities and social media influencers posting virtue-signaling photos of themselves flaunting their arm Band-Aids and immunization papers .
The playing field is rigged by internet titans skepticism as “ misinformation ” or “ conspiracy theory.
” It ’ s mass agitation and propaganda â agitatsiya â that would make the old Soviet Marxists proud .
The 21st-century twist is that Silicon Valley , Fortune 500 corporations and their nonprofit organs are pouring gobs of money to manufacture support for the public-private COVID vax regime .
The Ad Council alone â backed by major companies including Facebook , Google , NBC Universal , GM , Verizon , Walgreens , Walmart , Amazon , Apple and CBS/Viacom â has earmarked $ believe in coronavirus vaccines.
” The businesses and public relations agencies work closely with the Biden administration ’ s U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on crafting Big Brother-approved content .
The Ad Council bragged in January that its COVID-19 vaccine promotions had already resulted in “ 38.9 billion impressions , $ 424.7 million in donated media value , and 31.8 million visits to Coronavirus.gov.
” Even SpongeBob SquarePants has been enlisted to entice elementary schoolchildren to parrot the “ safe and effective ” by Nickelodeon ( the children ’ s network owned by Ad Council funder/partner CBS/Viacom ) .
There ’ s no mention , of course , of side effects , vaccine injury reports or risks to those with allergies and autoimmune diseases â let alone the importance of family sovereignty , freedom of conscience and informed consent .
The agitprop architects are also bribing Instagram stars and TikTok personalities to urge their thousands or millions of impressionable young fans to inject themselves with pharmaceutical products that are 1 ) still in the investigational stage liability at every step of development .
Neither of those facts ever finds its way onto the influencers ’ feeds , of course .
Your kids should know that their favorite Disney stars , Twitch video gamers and even “ Sesame Street ” characters have been recruited to pimp the COVID-19 vaccine .
One Instagram star and fashion blogger with 409,000 followers , South Carolina entrepreneur Whitney Rife Becker , spilled the beans on how “ two vaccine campaigns paying thousands of dollars ” had contacted her to “ go and get the selfie while getting the vaccine.
” She was asked to tell her followers how “ excited ” she was to take the vaccine and to gush about “ how much she would be able to do ” once she submitted to her shots .
She was promised that an unnamed entity would “ put money behind ” her Instagram videos or photo posts if she boosted the COVID vaccine .
Becker rejected the offers , but many others have accepted the bribery .
Sometimes , the quid pro quos mean cash .
In treatment .
In Florida , Miami ’ s Jackson Health System threw vaccine parties for social media influencers who agreed to write positive posts or produce videos about getting the Pfizer vaccine .
While there was “ no payment made to any influencer , ” the Internet stars and their “ plus ones ” moved to the head of the vaccine appointment line .
“ Each influencer will be allowed to bring one spouse , partner , or relative who meets Florida ’ s eligibility requirement ” to the party , health officials stars .
Joe Smyser , the head of a nonprofit called “ Public Good Projects , ” told Politico his outfit pays “ microinfluencers ” to post about getting the COVID vaccine and compensates them “ anywhere between tens to hundreds of dollars.
” The Oklahoma City-County Health Department has paid 35 young social media stars undisclosed sums to post government-approved COVID vaccine content and convince their peers that they need the shots to return to “ normal ” life .
This pay-for-play racket stirs fear , incentivizes herd thinking , stigmatizes independence of our young .
The most important thing parents can do to keep their children free and healthy is to block their exposure to the Astroturfed COVID agitprop campaign altogether .
Detox , deactivate , and deplatform them before they deplatform you .
In a word : Unplug .
