“ MY FEMINIST MOTHER TAUGHT ME TO HATE MY MANHOOD !
” Freedomain Call In Dear Stefan—I hope you are doing well !
I am writing you in despair , and would like to ask you to take just a minute for me to consider what I say .
I would like to share with you upfront that I feel anxious sending you this—reaching out and getting help from others is a difficult thing for me to do .
So , I ’ ve been part of our community for 7 years , and although it changed my outlook on I have not overcome the solitude of my childhood , yet .
I did not take your advice of getting into therapy early .
Now , my therapist is overbooked and struggles to find time for me .
I have started feeling depressed in June this year , triggered by a podcast of yours , talking about the dangers of deferral—sticking with bad relationships , and not finding the right partner .
I personally have never ever pursued a single woman in my life , and outright rejected those who approached me .
to become a great psychological helper , as a coach or therapist .
I have received much praise from people over the years , helping them gain clarity in their relationships .
However , I have not taken any training in this field , and am currently engaged in producing videos and social media posts in the health & fitness field , which I am not curious about pursuing as a career .
More or less all over sudden , I am overcome with regret , and am losing much of the positive week hiatus from my minimum-wage job , I ’ m distraught realizing I am still living the same small life as 7 years ago .
Please tell me outright if what I write doesn ’ t sound like the thing you would be open to discuss , but just in case there is a chance you might be able to take some time for me , would you at least hear my story ?
Maybe we can prevent at least one other person from making the same mistakes I made .
Thank you Stefan !
