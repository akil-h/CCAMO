“ Screw up , move up ” is standard operating procedure in corporate and government bureaucracies .
But in American journalism , the system goes far beyond rewarding incompetence .
It sanctifies bias .
It promotes dishonesty .
It incentivizes malice .
Want to get ahead in the liberal media ?
Just follow this credo : “ Spew lies , climb high.
” Take the case of professional character assassin Talia Lavin .
This week , she published a high-profile feature at MSNBC.com as an official “ MSNBC Opinion Columnist.
” The hit piece targets a new upstart group of from the establishment College Republican National Committee .
The students believe that many College Republican chapters have veered far-left on social issues , foreign policy , and immigration .
The split mirrors the widening schism between populists and elites in the D.C. GOP .
I know many of the leaders of the new College Republicans United organization personally and spoke to the Arizona State University-CRU chapter last year .
They are energetic patriots who embrace “ America First ” and mean it .
To Lavin , this is tantamount to “ white supremacy sounded the alarm that three campuses â ASU , the University of Arizona , and Iowa State University â now have CRU chapters .
The MSNBC.com headline of her hatchet job blared : “ College students are falling in love with white supremacy.
” Her proof that the kids are “ white supremacists ” ?
Their endorsement from me .
Yes , really .
Lavin reports : “ Operating under the innocuous-sounding name ‘ College Republicans United , ’ the group claims endorsements by fringe white nationalist figures like Michelle Malkin… ” There am indeed an unapologetic nationalist .
But newsflash , freaked-out fact-benders : I am brown and the last time I went “ fringe ” was when I sported bangs ( really bad , poofy ones ) in 8th grade circa 1984 .
Labeling everything and everyone she dislikes “ white supremacy ” and “ Nazis ” is Lavin ’ s entire schtick .
In 2018 , she falsely accused Justin Gaertner , a combat-wounded war veteran and computer forensic analyst for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency , of sporting a “ Iron Cross .
It was actually a Maltese Cross , the symbol of double amputee Gaertner ’ s platoon in Afghanistan , Titan 2 .
He lost both legs during an IED-clearing mission and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with Combat Valor and the Purple Heart before joining ICE to combat online child exploitation .
The Harvard-educated Lavin was forced to issue a fauxpology after losing her job as a “ fact-checker ” for the once-esteemed New Yorker magazine .
But she didn ’ t retract a single bilious word “ No , We Don ’ t Have To Be Friends with Trump Supporters , ” which endorsed hatred and violence against “ Nazis ” and ICE agents .
In it , she brazenly proclaimed : “ When they go low , stomp them on the head.
” Lavin then snagged a job as a lecturer for a New York University undergraduate journalism class ( canceled for lack of interest ) before serving as an “ extremism researcher ” for the George Soros-funded disinformation operation Media Matters for America , in 2019 .
that resulted in a 2020 book on white supremacy ( what else ? )
, recently published a feature op-ed in The Boston Globe on white supremacy ( what else ? )
, and was quoted earlier this month in The Forward to bolster the hysterical conspiracy theory that the Conservative Political Action Conference stage was deliberately shaped in the form of a Nazi “ runic symbol.
” While former President Donald Trump and countless thousands of conservatives have been purged from social media for expressing lawful , peaceful and truthful conservative opinions Twitter account to spread even more falsehoods .
In 2019 , she lied on Twitter about being “ chased ” from a free speech conference in Philadelphia .
The problem , as reporters from the Post Millenial pointed out , is that the conference venue was the highly secure and intensely surveilled Sugarhouse Casino .
The director of security confirmed that no foot chases or any incidents occurred : “ No one got chased.
” In 2020 , Lavin disseminated a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette photo of an anti-COVID lockdown activist holding a sign that ” That ’ s an English translation of the German slogan , “ Arbeit macht frei , ” which appears over the entrance of the Auschwitz concentration camp .
Lavin juxtaposed the two images with her caption : “ this is intentional.
” Smearing “ Reopen America ” protesters as Nazis might have worked if not for indie journalist Andy Ngo ’ s eagle eye .
He discovered that the photo had been doctored and that the sign actually read : “ Free Small Business.
” Instead of owning up to the deception spent the past year attacking Ngo as a “ fascist grifter.
” Spew lies , climb high .
At the rate she keeps fabricating upward , Talia Lavin may soon be co-anchoring the news on MSNBC with fellow serial prevaricator Brian “ Choppergate ” Williams .
Media liberalism has its privileges .
