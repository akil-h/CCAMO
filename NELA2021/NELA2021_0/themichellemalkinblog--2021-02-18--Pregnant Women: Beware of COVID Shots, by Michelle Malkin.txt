Twenty years ago , when I was pregnant with my first child , I transformed into a total health nut .
A lifelong couch potato , I started exercising , enrolled in Lamaze classes and even took vitamins for the first time .
I halted my consumption of caffeine , Doritos , Spam and sushi .
After decades of obliviousness to food labels , I began scrutinizing every additive and preservative listed in the teeny-tiny font on each item of my grocery list .
Now , imagine if our culture encouraged women of childbearing age to be as vigilant about experimental drugs on themselves and their unborn babies as they are about our diets .
We know all about gluten and carbs , trans-fats and Omega-3 fatty acids , mercury in fish and heavy metals in baby food .
But do you know what ’ s in the COVID-19 vaccines that an estimated 100 million Americans are expected to inject into their bodies by this spring ?
In December , I flagged concerns raised by Dr. Michael Yeadon , former vice president and chief scientific officer at Pfizer Global , regarding two additives glycol and mNeonGreen .
Yeadon and his colleagues warned of potential fertility-specific risks involving antibodies against “ spike proteins ” that could disrupt the development of placenta in vaccinated women .
It is “ unclear , ” they warned , “ what if any instructions/information ” that clinical trial subjects received regarding those risks .
Bear in mind that none of the clinical trials conducted by the vaccine-makers to win emergency use authorization from the federal government included pregnant women .
That has been historically true of drug trials because , as Dr. Doctors explained to me in an interview last week , the “ cascade of events that has to go one in the human body to get pregnant and maintain a pregnancy is incredibly complicated ” and “ we don ’ t know all the details of what we don ’ t know.
” Gold called it “ shocking ” that medical professionals and pregnant women or women of childbearing age “ would be advocating ” taking “ anything experimental.
” [ WATCH FULL INTERVIEW HERE . ]
Yes , let ’ s be the COVID-19 vaccines .
They are wholly experimental treatments manufactured and marketed by multinational corporations that are immune from liability for their products being tested , approved and distributed at warp speed .
An important white paper by America ’ s Frontline Doctors reminds citizens that COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer , Moderna and AstraZeneca are considered “ investigational ” in status and fall under legal standards for experimental medications .
The trials are ongoing and enrollees are tracked for at least the next two years .
“ We do not know the be pregnant , ” Gold and her colleagues report .
“ There is no actual data at all for an enormous percentage of the population , probably more than half.
” On top of all that uncertainty and lack of data , the “ mechanism of action of the experimental mRNA vaccines includes a possible auto-immune rejection of the placenta .
In layman ’ s terms , the vaccine may permanently interfere with a woman ’ s ability to maintain a pregnancy.
” In fact , as the labeling on COVID-19 vaccine vials t is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA VaccineBNT162b2 has an impact on fertility .
And women of childbearing age are advised to avoid pregnancy for at least two months after their second dose.
” Nevertheless , Dr. Anthony Fauci is now downplaying the risks of COVID-19 jab complications in pregnant women and claims there are “ no red flags , ” while the World Health Organization has warned that “ very little data are available to assess vaccine safety in pregnancy.
” Let me give you the bottom line on the “ expert ” safe for pregnant women : They just don ’ t know .
Yet , those who dare dissent from Big Pharma orthodoxy have been branded “ conspiracy theorists ” and are being pushed off social media .
Merely noting that the experts don ’ t know what they don ’ t know is smeared as “ misinformation ” or “ disinformation.
” ( You may remember I first warned you about this global censorship of vaccine dissidents in March 2019 . )
The National Vaccine Information Center ’ s VAERS database tracker has reported miscarriages , fetal death , premature delivery or stillbirth .
The background miscarriage rate is about 10-15 % , so you would expect some miscarriages to happen regardless of the vaccine .
But extreme caution is still advised .
Alex Berenson , former New York Times reporter and COVID-19 watchdog , asks : “ Where ’ s the safety data ?
” He reports that animal studies on COVID jabs have shown “ much higher rates of lost fetuses ” â and to date , the only such trials have been conducted , federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System data on human COVID-19 vaccine recipients have disclosed “ multiple cases of apparently healthy late-term fetuses lost days after vaccinations , ” Berenson adds .
“ Healthy pregnant women are at next to no risk from # Covid ; why on earth would anyone try to shame them into getting this vaccine ?
” For moms and moms-to-be , we must always follow the oath that so many COVID Inc. experts have abandoned : First , do no harm .
