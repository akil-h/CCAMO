WASHINGTON ( The Borowitz Report ) —With a new Associated Press poll showing Joe Biden garnering a sixty-three-per-cent general-approval rating , Republicans are accusing the President of “ artificially inflating ” that number through “ blatant displays of competence.
” “ Joe Biden is the consummate Washington insider , and he knows how to game these polls , ” Senator Rand Paul said .
“ If you want to get a high approval rating , all you have to do is do a job that people approve of.
” Senator Ted Cruz agreed .
“ Joe Biden is so desperate he ’ s been using every day in office to deliver results to the American people , ” he charged .
“ I for one find this behavior beneath contempt.
” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene called Biden ’ s seventy-one-per-cent approval rating for his handling of the pandemic “ a joke , ” noting , “ If all you care about is people liking the way you handle the pandemic , I guess you ’ d handle the pandemic all the livelong day .
Big whoop.
” The Senate Minority Leader , Mitch take no comfort ” in his high approval numbers .
