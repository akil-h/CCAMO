Did “ America First ” conservatives really “ win ” the battle over the GOP ’ s congressional leadership last week ?
Old-guard Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney may be out of power as the House Republican Conference chair .
But her replacement , New York GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik , is a swampy shape-shifter whose campaign coffers are filled with open borders , radical social liberal , Wall Street cash .
The multibillion-dollar moneyman behind Stefanik ’ s rise to power is Big Business oligarch Paul Singer .
He founded the hedge fund Elliott Management and propped up the political the gender card to victory : Stefanik in New York ’ s 21st congressional district ; anti-Trump establishment Republican Barbara Comstock in Virginia ’ s 10th congressional district ; and John McCain loyalist and Trump flip-flopper Martha McSally , who held Arizona ’ s second congressional district before losing her 2020 special election to retain the Senate seat she was appointed to when former Sen. Jon Kyl stepped down as the late McCain ’ s replacement .
Singer funded the Washington Free Beacon , ostensibly a “ conservative ” “ news ” website son-in-law , Matthew Continetti , which in turn hired the Fusion GPS opposition research outfit to compile the infamous Trump dossier â which was passed on to the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee after Trump won the GOP primary .
Singer helped raise $ 1 million for Trump-bashing Mitt Romney ’ s failed 2012 presidential bid , $ 1 million for Karl Rove ’ s Super PAC in 2014 , and $ 1 million for the failed 2016 presidential bid of pro-illegal amnesty shill Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla .
He agenda on the GOP .
He underwrote fellow failed GOP presidential candidate and former Florida Gov .
Jeb Bush ’ s Common Core advocacy .
He backed the open borders amnesty Republicans behind the “ Gang of Eight ” push for cheap foreign workers .
As I documented previously in this column and in my book , “ Sold Out , ” Singer helped fund the National Immigration Forum along with fellow hedge fund billionaire George Soros .
NIF propped up a faux “ grassroots ” initiative of religious conservatives , dubbed the the Gang of Eight .
NIF was founded by far-left attorney Rick Swartz , who opposes tracking/deporting visa overstayers and opposes employer sanctions against companies that violated immigration laws .
Swartz also served as an adviser to Microsoft .
On Capitol Hill , Swartz worked closely with immigration expansionist Sen. Spencer Abraham ’ s legislative director Cesar Conda and Sen. Sam Brownback ’ s legislative director ( and open borders , anti-Trump former GOP House speaker ) Paul Ryan .
Conda previously worked for the pro-amnesty U.S. Chamber of Commerce and mentored Ryan guided newbie Rubio as his Senate chief of staff from 2011-2014 and remains his powerful immigration Svengali behind closed doors .
While she may have earned Trump ’ s endorsement for the GOP No .
2 leadership position , Stefanik ’ s pedigree and financial allegiances lie with Ryan and his “ America Last ” sugar daddies .
Citing OpenSecrets campaign finance data , Breitbart.com reported that Singer consistently gave Ryan the maximum personal donation during his swamp tenure .
In addition , through his Elliot Management firm , Singer was one of associated super PACs .
One left-leaning website reported that over three election cycles ( 2014 , 2016 , 2018 ) , Stefanik was “ the second highest recipient of hedge fund contributions in the House , receiving $ 311,582 , ” behind House Speaker Paul Ryan ’ s nearly $ 600,000 take .
Stefanik served as Ryan ’ s top campaign adviser in 2012 after serving in the Singer-supported George W. Bush administration .
She praised her Beltway barnacle colleague as a “ true friend and mentor ” after he stepped down as that had nothing to do with wanting to “ spend more time with his children , ” as he claimed at the time , but everything to do with creating what he later called an “ escape hatch ” from his nemesis , Donald Trump ( and , of course , cashing in on the massive Super PAC war chest he built up duping rank-and-file Republican MAGA donors ) .
Swamp-marinated birds of a feather flock together .
The headlines may label Stefanik a “ Trump loyalist ” for now , but in party , principle or personality .
Follow the money ; find the truth .
