The mainstream media is slowly catching on to the “ Open Borders , Inc. ” racket .
Just this week , NBC News reported that smugglers are using Facebook to advertise their services in violation of Facebook ’ s policy ban on human exploitation and trafficking .
The news network appears shocked , shocked , shocked that coordinated illegal activity is booming on Facebookâone of the world ’ s biggest and most influential globalist platforms .
Maybe if the bleeding-heart libs in the Fourth Estate hadn ’ t been so busy carrying water for Mexican cartels and Big Business through illegal immigrant invasion over the past four years , they might have blown the whistle sooner on Silicon Valley ’ s co-conspirators with ruthless coyotes .
Only now has NBC News seen fit to enlighten the public about Spanish-language posts on public Facebook pages advertising “ Travel to Mexico to the United States .
Costs $ 8,000 .
100 percent safe ” or “ Make your dream a reality in the United States .
We are here to help you .
The journey is safe and reliable and the price is $ 4,500 Texas.
” That ’ s the tip of the iceberg .
In 2019 , I reported how smugglers and their clients worldwide have used Facebook and WhatsApp ( owned by Facebook ) to coordinate their journeys .
Pueblo Sin Fronteras , the most notorious sponsor of illegal immigrant caravans , still maintains a public Facebook page where its leaders taunt America , announce their border-breaching activities and post solicitations for supplies and donations .
Nongovernmental organizations , advocacy groups and financial institutions have created an additional array of free apps to “ help.
for Migration offers MigApp on Google Play and Apple ’ s App Store with information and “ assistance to migrate safely.
” The app features weather and crime alerts , medical clinic appointment scheduling and money transfer services ( more on that in a moment ) .
Similarly , the International Committee of the Red Cross ’ s WhatsApp alerts provide “ advice on how to avoid and prevent accidents , illness and being separated from family members , ” as well as a means “ to share the geolocation of a shelter the event of unexpected situations.
” United We Dream ’ s “ Notifica ” app is also available on Google Play and the Apple App Store .
It gives illegal immigrant travelers a “ help button ” to alert friends , family , lawyers , media propagandists and others in case of detention or encounters with law enforcement .
Border saboteurs have used technology for decades to help undermine immigration enforcement .
Ricardo Dominguez created a crowdsourced website-jamming network in the 1990s called the FloodNet system , which allowed anyone with an internet the U.S. Border Patrol , White House , G8 , Mexican embassy and others .
He then introduced the Transborder Immigrant Tool in 2009 using cheap $ 30 Motorola cellphones equipped with a free GPS applet to help illegal immigrants navigate desert routes , locate water stations and determine their proximity to highways .
An expert consulted by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees lauded “ how smartphones and social media have revolutionized ” migration , allowing illegal immigrants to bypass “ legal means ” of finding agents that “ take a long dark digital underworld ” for “ facilitating access to agents and smugglers ” through encrypted Facebook and WhatsApp channels .
Add to all this a new boom of peer-to-peer apps that facilitate illegal immigrant money transfers known as “ remittances.
” In 2017 , the aggregate cost of sending remittances was about $ 30 billion .
Old-line money transfer operators charge steep fees averaging about 7 % of the amount sent .
Among the plethora of competitors and disrupters jockeying in the migrant money market to peel away customers with lower transaction fees , Wise and WorldRemit .
Many of these apps integrate with Facebook ’ s Messenger Chat , Viber and WeChat .
WorldRemit , a start-up founded by a Somalian former United Nations official with venture capital backing from Facebook , Spotify , Netflix and Slack , is closing in on 600,000 transfers per month , according to Fast Company .
Just to make Silicon Valley ’ s allegiances clear : Apps owned or backed by Facebook , Google and Apple that aid and abet illegal immigration and human smuggling operate with impunity , law-abiding , free-speech apps such as Gab and Parler .
Untold thousands of nationalists have been deplatformed for defending our homeland , while cartels and coyotes exploit the internet and corporate oligarchs ’ cheap labor appetites to sabotage our borders and attack American sovereignty .
Who needs foreign enemies when domestic blind worship of the “ free market ” is destroying us from within ?
