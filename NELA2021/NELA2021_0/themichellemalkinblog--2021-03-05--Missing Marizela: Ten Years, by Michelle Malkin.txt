March 5 , 2011 .
I remember the moment like it was yesterday when my family contacted me in a panic to let me know that my 18-year-old cousin and goddaughter , Marizela “ EmEm ” Perez , had gone missing .
It ’ s the text you get in the middle of the night that doesn ’ t seem real .
Ten years ago this week , EmEm vanished from the University of Washington campus in the middle of a sunny afternoon .
She was last seen walking away from a Safeway grocery store in the U District and Once again , as I have done faithfully and heartachingly for the last decade , I must report that there is still no news on her whereabouts .
Nothing .
In 2019 , I finally received some Seattle Police Department documents in response to a public records request about her case .
But nothing in the trove shed light on any potential investigative leads .
In my home office , I keep a bulging file called “ Find Marizela.
” There are handwritten notes of conversations with police , carefully constructed timelines , around the piano singing Christmas hymns and carols .
There ’ s also a stack of missing person flyers emblazoned with the headline , “ HAVE YOU SEEN ME ?
” illustrated with screenshots from the Safeway surveillance video .
Pale and fleeting , EmEm looks like a ghostâdrained of the beautiful , bubbly energy she embodied as a child who loved baking cookies and playing board games with me .
The description on the flyer reads : “ Asian female , 5 ’ 5″ tall , 110 lbs , skinny build , highlights hairstyle , tattoo on left inner arm with the words ‘ lahat ay magiging maayos ’ ( all will be well ) , last seen wearing a dark jacket with hood over a light color sweater with hood , denim jeans , light brown suede laced boots , possibly wearing green eye contacts , carrying a denim drawstring backpack with rainbow butterfly screenprint , with a Macbook Pro laptop.
” The first weeks after she disappeared are now mostly a blur , but a few memories are indelible .
I remember breaking If I Die Young ” by The Band Perry at my then-7-year-old son ’ s talent show on the night before I flew out to Seattle to be with Marizela ’ s parents : If I die young , bury me in satin Lay me down on a bed of roses Sink me in the river at dawn Send me away with the words of a love song Lord make me a rainbow , I ’ ll shine down on my mother She ’ ll know I ’ m safe with you when your tears , keep ’ em in your pocket Save them for a time when you ’ re really gon na need them , oh I won ’ t forget the kindness of strangers and old friends who volunteered to help us search local parks and public streets .
I remember feeling lost and desperate in Discovery Park , staring out toward Puget Sound , praying to God , asking : “ Where ?
How ?
Why ?
” For all the negativity that surrounds the reputation of the national media , I the local reporters â Christine Clarridge at the Seattle Times and Shomari Stone at KOMO , in particular â who covered Marizela ’ s story with compassion and context .
Clarridge highlighted Marizela ’ s case , as well as the plight of other families with missing young adults , in a searing front-page feature on what parents go through in cases where the police have not found evidence of foul play .
Suicide was a primary assumption on the part of the police .
EmEm did have a history of depression .
â whose death in 1999 was reclassified as a homicide in 2011 by Washington police who mistakenly insisted the case was a suicide â shows the dangers of locking into assumptions without thoroughly exploring all leads .
Ten years on , the investigation into Marizela ’ s disappearance has all but come to a halt .
But if you live in the Washington area and have any relevant information about her whereabouts , please contact the Seattle Police Department at ( 206 ) 625-5011 .
And for those who have to go through wish on no one , I leave you with five hard-learned lessons from a decade ’ s worth of unknowing : 2 ) Take an immediate and full inventory of your loved one ’ s internet footprint â every email account , Facebook , Flickr , Twitter and social networking account .
3 ) Don ’ t assume the police are pinging cell phones , obtaining internet or phone records or obtaining surveillance camera video .
Don ’ t assume anything .
4 ) Make sure your loved one ’ s info gets Unidentified Persons System ) database immediately .
5 ) Don ’ t be afraid to be a squeaky wheel .
If you don ’ t speak up for your missing loved one , no one will .
