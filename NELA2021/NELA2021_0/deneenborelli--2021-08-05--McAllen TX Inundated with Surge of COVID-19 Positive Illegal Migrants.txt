Border city McAllen , Texas is inundated over a surge in illegal migrants as many are testing positive with COVID-19 .
A record number of illegal migrants were released in McAllen last week with over 1,500 positive cases of the virus .
Officials declared a local state of disaster .
Last week , a record-high 7,000 migrants were released in downtown McAllen , where they were immediately tested for the coronavirus through a city contractor .
More than 1,500 people tested positive over the past seven days , according to a city document issued Wednesday , compared to a total five months .
The city is so overwhelmed with illegal migrants that temporary shelters are being constructed .
Illegal migrants released under President Biden ’ s U.S. Customs and Border Protection are regularly transported to McAllen .
Morning , noon and night this week busloads carrying 50 to 100 migrants — with many very small children — have been dropped off at a corner in downtown McAllen across from the city ’ s bus depot and CCRGV ’ s Humanitarian Respite Center , the largest migrant shelter in the Rio Grande Valley .
( CDC ) is making matters worse .
As a record number of illegal migrants , including thousands that are COVID-19 positive , continue to enter the country along the southern border , the health and safety of Americans are at stake under President Biden ’ s administration .
It ’ s outrageous Biden is ignoring the crisis at the border , especially with the significant number of COVID-19 infected illegal migrants coming into the U.S .
