In September , Right Wing Watch reported that Rick Scarborough , a self-described “ Christocrat , ” strident anti-LGBTQ activist , and longtime critic of public education , had begun raising money through his group Recover America to fund an effort to elect right-wing candidates to school boards in three Houston-area school districts .
Earlier this month , Scarborough spoke at the Katy Christian Chamber of Commerce Breakfast in Houston , where he said that if they are successful in taking over these three school boards , he plans to raise millions of dollars to mobilize thousands of Texan pastors that conservative Christians “ take over their local school boards ” all across the state .
“ If we win these three school boards were weighing in on , then we ’ re going to go around Texas and do 50 events , ” Scarborough said .
“ We ’ ve got a $ 2 million budget for this and we got to raise it.
” “ We ’ ve already targeted about 55 locations , ” he continued .
“ We ’ re gon na send people in ahead of us if sure the pastors are there .
That ’ s the hard part .
When a pastor is confronted with the truth , if they ’ ve been called , they ’ re gon na respond .
And our goal is to get 2,000 pastors who will be patriot pastors in Texas once again [ and ] who will take over their local school boards—not take over but put Christians in offices , teach their people that they should run to those local offices .
And if they get excited about that , we coming up.
” Earlier in his presentation , Scarborough railed against teaching about LGBTQ equality in schools , vowing that if his effort is successful , they will be able to “ get this crap out of our schools.
” “ I ’ m not a Republican .
I ’ m not a Democrat .
I ’ m a Christocrat , ” Scarborough declared .
“ With God ’ s help , we ’ re going to try to shake Texas up and move her back to bright red as people vote pro-life of our schools .
