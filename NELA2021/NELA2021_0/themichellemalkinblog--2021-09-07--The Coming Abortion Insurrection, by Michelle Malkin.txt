I told you it was coming .
Back in May , on my show , “ Sovereign Nation , ” I chronicled significant signs of pro-life progress that were driving death-lobby Democrats mad â and I warned of a wave of intolerant tantrums to come as we hurtle into autumn .
It ’ s here .
In a 5-4 ruling last week , the U.S. Supreme Court refused to strike down the Texas heartbeat law protecting unborn babies as early as six weeks of age .
This follows nationwide adoption of heartbeat laws and other abortion restrictions in so many apocalyptically reported that “ 2021 is on track to become the most devastating antiabortion state legislative session in decades.
” Extremist pro-abortion ghouls immediately lamented last week that more innocent human lives with detectable heartbeats in the womb will be saved thanks to the decision .
Richard Hanania , a former Columbia University research fellow , complained that “ ( I ) f red states ban abortion , we could see a world where they have five times as many children with Down syndrome , and similar numbers for other disabilities.
” That unhinged rantings of actress Bette Midler , who called on all women to “ refuse to have sex with men ” in protest of state abortion restrictions .
( I ’ d venture a guess that plenty of men would not consider abstaining from sex with Bette Midler a punishment , but I digress . )
The mayor of godforsaken hellhole Portland , Oregon , Ted Wheeler , indignantly proposed a resolution banning city trade and travel with Texas until the state withdraws the law or it gets overturned in court .
( very few Texans will consider Portland ’ s abstinence and withdrawal from the Lone Star State a punishment , but again , I digress . )
A literal Satanic Temple announced plans to defy the law and assist any woman who “ wishes to undergo the Satanic Abortion Ritual within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy.
” Meanwhile , web-hosting company GoDaddy showed its Satan-sympathizing colors by yanking down a whistleblower website run by Texas Right to Life that aimed to support enforcement of the heartbeat law .
Pro-abortion bigotry is similarly out entertainment industries .
Standing up against the homicidal cancellation of unborn life will get you canceled by Hollywood and Silicon Valley .
The Food Network denounced former show host Josh Denny over his support for the Texas law , declaring that “ his views do not reflect our company values and we regret giving him a platform.
” Denny , God bless him , did not back down .
“ If you regret having ever given me a platform , ” the actor and comedian retorted , “ how about you send me of millions of dollars my show made for your network ( s ) ?
… You knew my views and my style of comedy when you hired me .
My views represent the beliefs of half of this country.
” Indeed .
Those views are also shared by John Gibson , who proclaimed publicly on Twitter that he was “ proud ” of the U.S. Supreme Court for affirming the Texas law protecting the unborn .
“ I felt it was important to go on the record as a pro-life game developer.
” , a Georgia-based video game developer and publisher , and until Sept. 6 , he was the CEO .
Throwing their own leader under the bus , Tripwire ’ s top brass wrote that they “ are deeply sorry and are unified in our commitment to take swift action and to foster a more positive environment.
” “ Sorry ” for allowing diversity of opinion to rear its terrible head !
This is all but a prelude to the real abortion insurrection .
On Oct. 2 , two days before the new Supreme leaders are planning the mother of all pro-abortion Women ’ s Marches in Washington , D.C .
These are the types of women who have turned up at past protests dressed as vaginas and vulvas , howling at the tops of their lungs while vandalizing public facilities with sanitary napkins , and storming the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court steps .
Very rich , isn ’ t it , coming from the same people who ’ ve been weaponizing Nov. 3 and Jan. 6 to cast their political opponents as the most dangerous May I remind you that each and every one of the heartbeat laws and pro-life protections adopted this year came about peacefully and lawfully .
Pro-lifers didn ’ t have to shut down highways , burn down businesses or incite violence like Women ’ s March allies in antifa and Black Lives Matter .
They worked through the system â and it ’ s still not unacceptable to the mob .
Watch who abides by the rules of civility â and who breaks the rules when they don ’ t get what they some Capitol takeovers are more protected and equal than the others .
I guarantee you that all the incessantly repeated narratives about “ white supremacists ” ( like brown-skinned me ) and Trump supporters being the real threats to democracy will be thoroughly debunked when the aggrieved abortion vigilantes in pink hats and raised fists return to Washington .
Mark my words .
