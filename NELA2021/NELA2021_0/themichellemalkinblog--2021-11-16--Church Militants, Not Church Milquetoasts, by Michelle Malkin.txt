These are abridged remarks I gave Tuesday morning in Baltimore at the “ Enough is Enough ” protest across from the annual gathering of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops .
Church Militant senior producer and St. Michael ’ s Media founder Michael Voris was forced to go to court to hold the prayer rally and gathering of Catholic dissidents after their permit was canceled by Baltimore ’ s speech-squelching city solicitor James Shea .
Baltimore authorities baselessly accused Voris and scheduled speakers of promoting violence ; the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower district judge ’ s the Constitution is at the heart of this case … The city can not conjure up hypothetical hecklers and then grant them veto power.
” I would first like to address the evil corruptocrats here in the city of Baltimore , right across from us at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , down at the White House , perched in the Vatican , and deeply embedded in the Deep State and Creep State .
Look at my face and the faces of every single Catholic bearing witness here today .
Hear our will not be silenced .
I would also like to directly address the lying corporate media â the so-called fact checkers , those narrative distortionists , control-freak gatekeepers and professional defamers who have tarred us one and all as violent domestic terrorists .
They poured fuel on the nationwide fires of the George Floyd riots .
They coddled bloodthirsty antifa demons tearing down the pillars of civil society .
They created monsters such as Shaun King who smeared us as “ white supremacists ” and incited acts of vandalism against our places of over the past two years to the targeting of Catholic churches , decapitation of Catholic statues and bloody assaults on prayerful Catholics .
Hear our voices .
Heed our words .
This is what truly peaceful protest looks like .
I am humbled to join you all today to speak about the unholy alliance of radical bishops , Open Borders Incorporated and pandemic profiteers .
But first , I must take a moment to honor every brave survivor of clerical sexual abuse in the audience or on the speakers ’ roster here today shame , denial and lack of transparency all darkened the path .
The survivors shined their light and showed us the way .
I believe the same is true for the Catholic Church ’ s deplorable racketeering for mass , uncontrolled immigration and shilling for Big Pharma ’ s toxic and sinful enterprise .
Since 1986 , when open-borders lobbyists were hammering out the disastrous Reagan amnesty on Capitol Hill , Catholic leaders in the U.S. and abroad have moved from fighting against legislation that enhances American immigration enforcement to actively undermining enforcement Cardinal Roger Mahony , censured and banned for his role in covering up sexual abuse , was booted from his post in Los Angeles yet continues to this day to advocate that Catholic clergy and other Americans brazenly defy deportation orders and harbor so-called Dreamers in the name of charity and compassion .
These policies have enriched cartels , traffickers , smugglers , coyotes and the vast network of left-wing nonprofits while inducing the poor to traipse across the desert , stuff themselves in car trunks and cash in on their own children of the need to drain the Catholic Deep State and defund the Creep State ?
Archbishop Jose Gomez , head of the Los Angeles archdiocese , blasted former President Donald Trump ’ s workplace enforcement actions and bemoaned the plight of outlaws “ who live in the shadows.
” Bishop Thomas Joseph Tobin of the Providence , Rhode Island , diocese issued a declaration of support for driver ’ s licenses for illegal aliens in his state , citing the pope ’ s call “ to welcome immigrants into our midst ” because its Church.
” In 2019 , the USCCB sat on net assets of \ $ 377 million and raked in total revenues of \ $ 188 million .
Its annual government grant revenue totaled nearly \ $ 50 million ; with \ $ 23 million funneled to a program encouraging illegal alien unaccompanied minors to trespass our borders ; \ $ 16.5 million for refugee admissions ; and \ $ 12.1 million for refugee and entrant assistance .
In 2020 , Catholic Charities vacuumed up \ $ 5 billion â \ $ 2 .
My time is short , but know this : The same evil rationale for covering up clerical sex abuse , covering the cover-up of clerical sex abuse is the same evil rationale behind profiting off open borders and national suicide , and it is the same evil rationale for pushing experimental pharmaceutical jabs inextricably conceived with the cells of murdered unborn babies to quell , control , track and trace the world ’ s population .
Pandemic profiteers are false saviors in a soul-destroying industry that relies on rigged clinical trials , the vaccine-injured , persecution of devoutly pro-life parents and workers whose pleas for support as they face losing their jobs and livelihoods are being spurned by junk-science promoting priests and bishops , and blanket protection from corporate liability in the name of the “ common good.
” In the face of such godlessness and ruin , our faith must be stronger than our fear .
We must be engaged in all-out spiritual warfare â fully immunized against the real deadly viruses of moral relativism , cultural Marxism and globohomogenized capitalism .
Church Militants for such a time as this .
