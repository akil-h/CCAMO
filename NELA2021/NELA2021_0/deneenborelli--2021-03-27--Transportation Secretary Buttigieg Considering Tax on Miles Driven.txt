President Biden is searching for ways to support his massive $ 3 trillion infrastructure plan and driving appears to be on the radar screen as a funding mechanism .
During an interview on CNBC , Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said a new way to tax vehicles is on the table .
Instead of raising taxes on gasoline , Buttigieg discussed the possibility of placing a tax on the number of miles driven , saying , “ A so-called vehicle-miles-traveled tax or mileage tax , whatever you want to call it , could be a way to do it.
” Buttigieg lot of promise.
” Unsurprisingly , the new tax trial balloon was blasted by conservatives .
Another concern raised by this type of taxing mechanism is it would be a way for the federal government to track individuals .
Other critics urged the government to tax billionaires instead of middle-class Americans .
Taxing driving will especially harm individuals and families that chose to live in rural or suburban areas which are basically from the middle class .
Hopefully , Buttigieg ’ s comments are just a trial balloon but if it ’ s example of Biden targeting the forgotten men and women of the U.S. Let ’ s just call it the “ deplorables tax !
