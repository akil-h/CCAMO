Two California intake centers for illegal migrant children are dealing with COVID-19 positive children .
The sites are operated under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and were recently opened .
Children infected with COVID-19 were placed in isolation .
While some COVID-19 positive children are isolated , the Biden administration is allowing illegal migrants to fly across the country , at taxpayer ’ s expense , without proof of not being infected and without photo identification .
From February 19 to April 22 , the Biden administration has placed about 7,200 border crossers on commercial domestic flights The border crossers are allowed to bypass photo ID requirements , the standard rules all American citizens are required to abide by , and do not have to show proof of a negative coronavirus test before flying .
Vice President Kamala Harris , appointed by President Biden to handle the border crisis , has yet to visit the U.S.-Mexico southern border .
This week , Harris claimed there were several reasons for the border surge including “ the lack of climate adaptation and climate resilience.
” My husband Tom commented about Harris not because she ’ s afraid of a bad photo opportunity that will personally tie her to the crisis .
The Biden administration continues to ignore the seriousness of illegal migrants flooding the southern border , including adults and children infected with COVID-19 .
