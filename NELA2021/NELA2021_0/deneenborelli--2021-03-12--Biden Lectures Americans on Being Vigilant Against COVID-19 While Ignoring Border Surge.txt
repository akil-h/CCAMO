On the first anniversary of COVID-19 being declared a pandemic , President Biden delivered a prime-time speech lecturing Americans to be vigilant against the virus by following Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) guidelines while ignoring the surge of illegal migrants flooding the U.S.-Mexico border .
Since President Biden took office , there ’ s been an influx of illegal migrants trying to gain access into the U.S. , including a surge in unaccompanied children .
Most alarming is some of the migrants tested positive for COVID-19 .
Last week , it was reported over 100 illegal aliens released COVID-19 in Texas , and some of those who tested positive were not quarantined and continued to travel .
This health crisis is exacerbated by the fact that illegal migrants don ’ t have to be tested for the virus , putting the health of Americans at risk .
Since the start of his administration , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) has revamped the Catch and Release program .
To date , Biden does not require coronavirus tests for border crossers before their release .
Only migrants enrolled in the take tests .
The Biden administration isn ’ t the only one downplaying the humanitarian and health crisis at the southern border .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi mocked the crisis at the southern border .
On NewsmaxTV , Dr. Tom Borelli slammed Biden for catching and releasing migrants carrying COVID-19 potentially infecting Americans nationwide .
Since taking office , this was Biden ’ s first time addressing the nation and he was criticized for not holding a press conference for 50 days since his presidency .
President Biden lecturing Americans on COVID-19 while not only hypocritical but grossly irresponsible .
