WASHINGTON ( The Borowitz Report ) —Casting a dark cloud over the select committee investigating the January 6th insurrection , congressional Republicans protested , in no uncertain terms , the panel ’ s “ utter lack of rioters.
” Leading the charge was House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , who called the commission “ little more than a gussied-up festival of anti-riot propaganda.
” “ Nancy Pelosi ’ s handpicked Democratic panel members all have one thing in common : none of them took part in the riot , ” McCarthy said .
“ Without an equal number of rioters never get to hear both sides of this thing.
” McCarthy said that he had drawn up a list of potential rioters to serve on the commission , including the “ QAnon Shaman , ” Jake Angeli .
“ I ’ ve spoken to the Shaman , and he ’ s up for it , ” McCarthy said .
“ He just got his fur pelts dry-cleaned.
” The House Minority Leader warned Pelosi against proceeding with the commission if it had no rioter representation .
“ It could have a chilling effect said .
