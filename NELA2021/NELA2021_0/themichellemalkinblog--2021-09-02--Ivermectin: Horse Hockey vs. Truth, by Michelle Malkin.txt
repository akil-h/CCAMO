Shhhhh .
The information Iâm about to share with you is dangerous and subversive .
You can not publish it on social media platforms without risking scary labels and permanent suspensions .
You and anyone you discuss this topic with will be called anti-science âkooks , â âconspiracy theorists , â or âquacks.â So be it .
Iâve been called every pejorative name in the globalist elitesâ overworn handbook of ad hominem over the past 30 years .
Who cares ?
The airwaves have been littered the past month with disparaging reports about Ivermectin , which the U.S. Food and to treat or prevent COVID-19 .
âYou are not a horse .
You are not a cow .
Seriously , yâall Stop it , â the official FDA Twitter account snidely admonished last week .
Well , you are not a sheep , either .
So donât be cowed by Big Pharma and their bought-off Swamp bureaucrats .
Seriously , yâall .
These are the performative actors whoâve flipped and flopped on masks , rushed experimental jabs to market , brazenly denied deadly adverse events , and advocated mix-and-match booster shots as part in human history .
First things first : The government and corporate mediaâs repeated description of Ivermectin in headline after headline as a âhorse de-wormerâ is pure propaganda .
Yes , it is used as an anti-parasitic for animals .
But Ivermectin has been used to treat humans for parasitic infections for more than three decades .
As Wisconsin critical care specialist Dr. Pierre Kory and his colleagues affiliated with the Memphis VA Medical Center-University of Tennessee , University of Texas Health Science Center , Hackensack School of Medicine , and Eastern Virginia review published in the peer-reviewed medical journal , the American Journal of Therapeutics : âOriginally introduced as a veterinary drug , [ Ivermectin ] soon made historic impacts in human health , improving the nutrition , general health , and well-being of billions of people worldwide ever since it was first used to treat onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) in humans in 1988 .
It proved ideal in many ways , given that it was highly effective , broad-spectrum , safe , well tolerated , and could be easily administered .
Although it internal nematode infections , it was most known as the essential mainstay of 2 global disease elimination campaigns that has nearly eliminated the world of two of its most disfiguring and devastating diseases.â Thatâs right .
Billions of humans around the world have taken Ivermectin ( approved by the FDA and considered an âessential medicineâ by the World Health Organization ) under mass distribution programs to eradicate onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) and other tropical diseases .
Ivermectin has also been shown to inhibit a broad range of viruses in laboratory studies , virus , and other RNA viruses .
In 2018 , more than 130,000 patients in the U.S. were prescribed the drug .
It is a human drug no matter how many times the mad cows in the media try to fear-monger you into believing otherwise .
So , should Ivermectin be pursued as a treatment or prophylaxis for COVID-19 ?
The COVID control freaks donât even want you to ask the question out loud or debate it on the Internet .
But unlike farm animals , you can exercise your free will and study in the peer-reviewed journal Antiviral Research reported that Ivermectin inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and concluded that âivermectin is worthy of further consideration as a possible SARS-CoV-2 antiviral.â *An analysis published in the peer-reviewed journal International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents in November 2020 found that âcountries with routine mass drug administration of prophylactic chemotherapy including ivermectin have a significantly lower incidence of COVID-19â¦ Prophylactic use of ivermectin against parasitic infections is most common in Africa and we hence show that the reported correlation is highly significant both when compared among worldwide contextâ¦It is suggested that ivermectin be evaluated for potential off-label prophylactic use in certain cases to help bridge the time until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available.â *A small , pilot double-blind , placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted in Spain and published in The Lancet in January didnât find statistically significant differences in COVID viral loads , but did find âa marked reduction of self-reported anosmia/hyposmia , a reduction of cough and a tendency to lower viral loads and lower [ antibody ] titers which warrants assessment in larger trials.â *A in the peer-reviewed journal Nature found that it âcould serve as a potential candidate in the treatment of a wide range of viruses including COVID-19 as well as other types of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses.â *A study in the peer-reviewed journal Chest found statistically significant lower mortality rates among hospitalized COVID patients prescribed Ivermectin ( along with hydroxychloroquine , azithromycin , or both ) compared with patients without Ivermectin in Broward County , Florida .
