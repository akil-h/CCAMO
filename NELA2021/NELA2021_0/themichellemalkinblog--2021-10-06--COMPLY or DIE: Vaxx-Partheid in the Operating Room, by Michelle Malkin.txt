Photo : Colorado Springs friends and Bible study classmates Leilani Lutali ( left ) and living donor volunteer Jaimee Fougner ( right ) For nearly 20 years , Iâve reported on Americaâs medical welcome mat for chronically sick illegal aliens .
Under a 1986 federal law , âunauthorized immigrantsâ with conditions such as kidney disease and cancer can not be denied emergency room care , regardless of their immigration status or inability to pay .
Open-borders politicians insist health care is a ârightâ that every last border-jumper is entitled toâand which every last American taxpayer must subsidize .
According to study published by the American Journal of Kidney Disease , there are between nearly 9,000 illegals with kidney failure in the U.S. Thereâs now a COVID-era push to provide them not only with emergency-room dialysis ( at an estimated cost of \ $ 400,000-per-illegal alien-per-year ) , but also outpatient dialysis under Medicaid .
Conveniently , the United Network for Organ Sharing and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network do not document immigration status , so there are no reliable estimates of exactly how many illegal aliens have received organ transplants in the U.S. 400 illegal aliens who had received kidney transplants since 2005 âmost in California at taxpayer expense .
Keep all this government-backed generosity for illegal alien patients in mind as I tell you about the plight of Leilani Lutali , a law-abiding American citizen and Colorado Springs executive recruiter diagnosed with Stage IV kidney disease last November .
Her condition worsened over the summer , leading her medical providers at UCHealth in Denver to begin discussion of an organ transplant .
Blessed with a close-knit network of friends through her local Bible study , Fougner , a former Air Force medic , triathlete , and medical assistant who has spent more than two decades in the health care field .
âIt was an easy decision to make , â Jaimee reflected .
âWhy would I not want to save my friendâs life ?
â Everything was moving along smoothly until last week , when Jaimeeâs donor coordinator at UCHealth asked about her vaccination status .
Jaimee is unvaccinated and won a religious exemption from her employerâs jab-or-job mandate .
Leilani has already had COVID and told me Like Jaimee , Leilani has religious objections to the COVID vaccine manufacturersâ use of aborted fetal cells .
Moreover , Leilani told me , âIâm not âanti-vax.â I got my shots as a kid and for business travel .
Itâs specifically about the COVID shots , which have not been out long enough .
Thereâs no comprehensive data.â No matter .
âTrust the science , â stop asking questions , and comply or die .
Leilani and Jaimee told me they were informed by one of the transplant coordinators that if they didnât transplant âjourney would come to an end.â Leilani says they were âtold flat-out that there would be no exemptions , ” even though UCHealth does allow its own staff to apply for medical and religious waivers .
Leilani pushed for alternatives such as a negative COVID test .
No go .
Leilani has now been placed on the âinactiveâ listâa death sentence .
I reached out to UCHealth , whose communications vice president Dan Weaver confirmed in a statement to me that , âIn almost all situations , transplant recipients and living donors vaccinated against COVID-19 in addition to meeting other health requirements and receiving additional vaccinations.â Welcome to vaxx-partheid in the operating room .
In their discussions with Leilani and public relations materials sent to me , UCHealth officials have imperiously compared exercising the choice to decline the COVID vaccine to irresponsible behavior such as smoking or drinking before or after an organ transplant .
Ridiculous .
As Leilani told friends and family in a Facebook post about her plight : âI have done the research on transplant patients and there isn ’ t substantive provide antibodies to fight off the Delta variant post transplant.â Jaimee adds that the COVID vaccine clinical trials excluded severely immunocompromised patients and a peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Hepatology published in August found âpoor antibody responseâ after COVID vaccination among 61 percent of liver transplant patients and 24 percent of patients with chronic liver disease .
Colorado state Republican Rep. Tim Geitner heard about Leilaniâs case and blasted UCHealthâs decision as âdisgustingâ in a Facebook livestream video ( which of course has already been appended with the Narrative Control Freaksâ pro-COVID brings great concern for many of us…where based on your vaccination status with COVID , you would actually be denied care.
” Indeed .
âWhere does this stop ?
â Jaimee asks .
âIf itâs okay to deny life-saving transplants to the unvaxxed , are cancer patients next ?
â Yes , my fellow citizens , we have now arrived at the insane point in America where unlawful immigration status provides more protection than unvaccinated statusâand where health care is a taxpayer-subsidized right for indigent illegal aliens , but not faithful , pro-life .
âI didnât want to be the poster child , â Leilani told me Monday .
But after much thought and prayer , she came forward to âbe a voice for those who have no voice.â All it takes is one to become hundreds , thousands , and millions in such a time as this .
Who in power will speak for Leilani ?
Please stand up .
The clock is ticking .
