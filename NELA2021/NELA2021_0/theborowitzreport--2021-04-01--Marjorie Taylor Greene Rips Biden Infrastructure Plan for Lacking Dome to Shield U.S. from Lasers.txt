ATLANTA ( The Borowitz Report ) —President Biden ’ s infrastructure plan came under harsh attack from the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene , who argued that the bill contains “ no provision whatsoever ” for building a giant dome to shield the nation from Jewish space lasers .
Greene , whose address to the House of Representatives was interrupted at several points by standing ovations from her Republican colleagues , said that the absence of a dome to offer protection against Hebraic laser attacks made the bill a “ non-starter.
” “ I can not in good conscience support , bridges , and broadband but not a penny for giant-dome construction , ” she said .
Putting a human face on the need for such a dome , Greene said , “ I , for one , live in constant fear of lasers , except for Friday after sundown.
