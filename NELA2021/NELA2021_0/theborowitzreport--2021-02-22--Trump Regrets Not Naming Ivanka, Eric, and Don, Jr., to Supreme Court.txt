WASHINGTON ( The Borowitz Report ) —Donald J. Trump said on Monday that his “ greatest regret ” as President was his failure to name his three adult children to the United States Supreme Court .
Appearing on Fox News , Trump said that Ivanka , Eric , and Don , Jr. , would be “ way better judges ” than “ those three clowns ” whom he did name .
“ Gorsuch , Kavanaugh , and Barrett are the worst people who have ever worked for me , ” he said .
“ And that includes Scaramucci.
” When York prosecutors could obtain his tax returns , Trump said , “ none of those three boneheads even called to ask me what they should do .
No gratitude whatsoever.
” He said that “ laws needed to be changed ” to keep Supreme Court Justices from “ thinking for themselves.
” “ This should never be allowed to happen in our country , ” he said .
