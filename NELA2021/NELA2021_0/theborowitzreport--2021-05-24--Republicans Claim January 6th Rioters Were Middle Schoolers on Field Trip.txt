WASHINGTON ( The Borowitz Report ) —Republicans on Capitol Hill are arguing that a proposed January 6th commission is uncalled for because the rioters were merely middle schoolers on a field trip .
Speaking to reporters , Senator Ron Johnson , of Wisconsin , said that , after reviewing footage of the riot , “ It ’ s plain to see that this was just a bunch of middle-school kids who got a little rowdy.
” “ I ’ ve had teen-agers , and I know what kind of horseplay and tomfoolery they can get up to , ” he set up a commission every time they raised a little heck.
” Claiming that the rioters ’ behavior should be expected of “ a bunch of crazy kids looking to cut loose , ” Johnson said that the responsibility for investigating them belongs “ not to Congress but to their teachers.
” “ I think the teachers need to find out who were the class clowns behind these stunts , and say to them , ‘ Any more nonsense like this and you ’ re not going to the water park on the he said .
