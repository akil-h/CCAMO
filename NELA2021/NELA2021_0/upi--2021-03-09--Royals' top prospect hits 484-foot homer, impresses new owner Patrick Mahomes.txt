March 9 ( UPI ) -- Even Patrick Mahomes was impressed by a recent home run hit by Kansas City Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. in spring training .
The NFL star -- and Royals minority owner -- celebrated the longball on Twitter .
Witt 's 484-foot blast came in the fourth inning of the Royals ' 10-3 win over the Oakland Athletics on Monday in Surprise , Ariz .
The Royals led 5-1 entering the bottom of the fourth inning .
Nicky Lopez brought in a sixth run with an RBI groundout .
Whit Merrifield followed with an RBI stepped into the box to face Athletics pitcher Yusmeiro Petit .
The star prospect proceeded to smash a Petit offering very deep to left field .
The blast easily cleared the outfield fence , in addition to a small hill on the other side of the wall .
Mahomes tweeted three rocket ship emojis and Witt 's Twitter handle -- along with a video of the homer -- Monday on Twitter .
Witt 's blast traveled 109 mph as it left the field , according to Statcast .
Salvador Perez hit another home Witt 's wallop .
The Athletics scored the final two runs of the game on a Francisco Pena two-run homer in the top of the sixth frame .
Witt -- the Royals ' top prospect and the No .
7 prospect in baseball -- went 1 for 2 in the victory .
He is now hitting .353 with two home runs and six RBIs this spring .
The 20-year-old infielder was the No .
2 overall pick in the 2019 MLB Draft .
He has yet to make his MLB debut .
`` where I 'm supposed to be right now , '' Witt told reporters Sunday .
`` I 'm just having a lot of fun . ''
Witt hit .262 with a home run and 27 RBIs in 37 rookie league games in 2019 .
Mahomes , 25 , purchased a portion of the Royals in July , the same month he signed a record 10-year , $ 504 million contract extension with the Kansas City Chiefs .
Mahomes ' father -- Patrick Sr. -- played 11 seasons at the MLB level .
