Radical right-wing commentator Josh Bernstein posted a video on his website Sunday night reacting to former President Donald Trump ’ s speech at CPAC earlier in the day in which Trump called on states to enact a variety of voter suppression measures , such as requiring voter ID and limiting the use of early voting and mail-in voting .
Bernstein agreed with Trump ’ s recommendations but faulted him for not going far enough .
“ We can not have early voting , ” Bernstein declared .
“ We should have one day to vote , and no , it off , OK ?
You either go before work , you either go on your lunch break , or you go after work .
That ’ s it .
If you can ’ t get there in that one day , then it wasn ’ t important enough for you , and to be quite frank , I don ’ t want you to vote .
If you can ’ t make it in that one day , stay home.
” Bernstein said that only those in the military or who are sick , but it should only be available the week before the election .
He also called for the Constitution to be amended to outlaw the use of mail-in voting for any other reason .
Bernstein then insisted that we must “ raise the voting age to a minimum of 21 ” and that every voter must provide “ proof of income ” at the polling place .
“ I want proof of income at the polling stations , ” he said .
“ I want to see that you have skin in the on sponging off of the system .
… I ’ m talking about people on welfare and things like that , that have been on the system and have been exploiting the system for many , many , many years .
They should not be allowed to vote .
You should have skin in the game because you ’ re probably going to vote for the people that are going to keep you dependent on them , and that ’ s not good for the country.
” “ I ’ ll admit it want to make it harder to vote in America , not easier .
